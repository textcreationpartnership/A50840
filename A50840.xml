            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>This ſence of Duty made him vigorouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Ingreſs of Popery in the laſt Reign, it made <hi>Him too</hi> contribute his Handful of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to quench the growing flames, and freely to expoſe himſelf to the Anger of an unhappily Bigotted Prince, and the impotent diſguſts of hot-headed Renegadoes from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This made him as jealous of that impudent Pamphlet aſſuming the Title of the <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> which finding very buſily ſcattered abroad, he deſigned it a particular Anſwer: when a very Reverend Prelate of our Church—</p>
            <q>—Cujus Nomen—ſemper acerbum,</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Semper Honoratum, ſic Dii voluiſtis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebit</hi>— giving him notice of Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s excellent Performance, and Dr.
<hi>Jane</hi>'s Promiſe with a peculiar reſpect to that Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, He ſtopt his Pen, as judging Himſelf too mean a Second for ſo learned and able <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers.</p>
            <p>But the News of increaſing Socinianiſm and a clear apprehenſion of the Peſtilent and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational Nature of that Hereſie made Him caſt his thoughts that way again: and ſince it would <pb facs="tcp:102432:5"/> be Puſhing out, He believed his Pains could not be ill ſpent in Expoſing what the <hi>Wiſdom of the Nation</hi> thought fit to except from their too much <hi>abus'd Indulgence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He thinks too many Hands cannot be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſo neceſſary a Service, and ſince our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Zealots by their numerous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets are opening the Way, in Conjunction with other Sects, for Atheiſm and Irreligion, and ſo many <hi>Beaux Eſprits,</hi> the <hi>would-be Wits</hi> of the Age, try to cloak Atheiſm under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of aſſerting <hi>The Rational Religion,</hi> He ſhould think himſelf very guilty, were He ſilent when He had any thing to ſay againſt them.</p>
            <p>The Refutation of theſe daring Errors is ſaid to be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaken by ſeveral of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend London Clergy,</hi> Men doubtleſs of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient abilities to baffle a thouſand ſuch little Whifflers in Reaſon as We are now peſtered with: But while they delay the Work too long, the Author of this will think it happily publiſh'd if it ſerve only to excite their pious Zeal, and oblige Them to make up the Defects of this by their more accurate and Learned Arguments.</p>
            <p>It has affixed no ſmall ſcandal upon ſome otherwiſe
<hi>Venerable Names</hi> that they have made their Converſe too cheap to the bold <hi>Spreader</hi> of Socinian Papers, and while He takes Courage to break Laws under Covert of their Patronage, They can no way better vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Church of God or their own Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or repreſs Impudent Ignorance, than
<pb facs="tcp:102432:6"/> by a vigorous and ſpeedy oppoſition to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Endeavours.</p>
            <p>As for his own Performance in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheets, the Author has endeavoured to give its due force to a Text He thinks very plain for the
<hi>eternal Deity of our Saviour,</hi> and to expoſe Socinian Criticiſm on that and other places of Scripture, and has laid open ſome of thoſe pitiful Artifices they make uſe of to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Word of God.</p>
            <p>He has eſſayed to ſet <hi>Humane Reaſon</hi> in its true Light, to give it its juſt Weight in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Matters, to ſhew the influence Divine Revelation ought to have upon it, and yet after All, He believes not that any Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does or can ſuperſede any truly Rational Principle.</p>
            <p>Many are taken up as <hi>ſuch,</hi> which yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate themſelves by that Oppoſition they meet with from Others of as Acute Parts as thoſe who firſt vend Them, only ſuch wherein all Diſcurſive Souls agree can properly be called <hi>True Principles of Reaſon,</hi> and theſe too are only ſuch in the particular Parts of Knowledge to which they belong, an <hi>Euclidean</hi> Demonſtration can have no Place in Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, Nor can the Aſſertion of a Trinity prove the impoſſibility of ſquaring a Circle.</p>
            <p>Weak Eyes are ill Judges of the various Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications of Light, and Deaf Ears of the delicate Harmony of Sounds: Reaſon in the Soul may meet with as many Obſtructions from the different Organization of that Body in
<pb facs="tcp:102432:6"/> which the Soul acts; and however large the Minds of <hi>Socinus, Crellius,</hi> or his preſent Nephew may be, <hi>T. F's</hi> Capacity muſt be very well tenter'd e'er it can comprehend all their Niceties, or ſee clear Reaſon confirming every one of their ill-connected Heterodoxies.</p>
            <p>Tho' the incomparable Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> has managed that Subject, as He uſes to do All, with the greateſt Clearneſs and Learning, this Author too had endeavoured to prove <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries not unreaſonable in Religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and it being done before the preaching of that <hi>Great Man's</hi> Sermon, He was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Expunge it: The Author thinks He too has proved in ſome Meaſure that there may be <hi>a God,</hi> tho' We cannot comprehend Him, that there may be ſuch a thing as
<hi>Religion,</hi> tho' God ſhould be ſomewhat Wiſer than Men, and that, though Ignorance be no Mother of true Devotion, yet Men of improved <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may meet with ſome Religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>above their reach,</hi> and that it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the more a modeſt Man knows, the more truly ſenſible He may be of his own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
            <p>He has proved Jeſus Chriſt to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> the manner of his <hi>Filiation</hi> is debated out of its proper place, and indeed was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned at all, had not ſome <hi>Anonymous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteers</hi> given occaſion for it, who coming to his Hand after the former part was finiſhed, He was obliged either to croud it in elſewhere, or elſe to omit it altogether.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102432:7"/>The Argument inſerted to prove <hi>Scripture the Word of God</hi> to thoſe who acknowledge ſuch a Being is indeed a
<gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Socinus</hi>'s Diſcourſes <hi>De Authoritate SS. Scripturae,</hi> or ſuch like are ſufficient Proof that He thought the Books of the Old and New Teſtament were written by Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>Whatever He did, his <hi>Atheiſtical Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates</hi> own their ſuſpitions, but veil their madneſs under a more plauſible Name, and this Author can ſcarce diſtinguiſh between an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> and

            <p>From that Diſquiſition the Author enters more directly on the proof of <hi>our Saviour's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> and ſhews what He ought to have been, and therefore what He was. He's apt to think ſeveral Writers Antient and Modern have drawn ſome Texts into the Service imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent enough and quite beſide their Original ſence; but believes He has named ſome, and could have added more, which unleſs we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce underſtanding mens Minds by their Expreſſions, muſt prove that our Redeemer was true, was perfect God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102432:7"/>Thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion have not more tricks and wretched ſubterfuges from clear Texts and rational Arguments urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> or <hi>Idolatry,</hi> than our
<hi>Unitarians</hi> make uſe of to elude plain Aſſertions, and the common Notions of the Antient Jewiſh and Chriſtian Churches.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> afford good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the caſe, <hi>the New</hi> does ſo much more; And the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles were a company of Trapans and ill deſigning Men to tell us ſtories of Chriſt's Words and Actions which ſhould make us believe Wonders of Him and conclude Him <hi>a partaker Eſſentially of the divine Nature,</hi> when He was really no more than a <hi>meer Man,</hi> moved but in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſphere, lived Innocent by the infuſed activity of Divine Grace, and without that Influence <hi>ab Extra</hi> might have ſinned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred Damnation as well as others.</p>
            <p>What He himſelf did in his Own, and what his Apoſtles did in His Name, was of ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent a Nature, that ſhould the ſame things be done now by any other Perſon, or in his Name, the World would in ſpite of all the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Arguments conclude ſuch a <hi>Perſon True and Real God:</hi> We ſee the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> for one Miracles ſake were ſo poſſeſt with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> that a <hi>Socinus</hi> or a <hi>Crellius,</hi> with all their pretty Pleas to that purpoſe, might have met with <hi>Pentheus</hi>'s fate among them, and have dyed the Martyrs of unplauſible Sophiſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102432:8"/>The Author has given a ſhort account of the
<hi>Primitive Faith</hi> in the Point under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and nothing but extreme Ignorance could make any of our <hi>Unitarians</hi> pretend to <hi>true Antiquity</hi> for his fancy. Our late <hi>Putney Convert</hi> indeed could find <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> among the Rabbins, and our great
<hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſts</hi> have ſometimes dream'd of proving our Saviour's
<hi>meer Humanity</hi> by the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the glorious Anti-Nicene Fathers.</p>
            <p>It was not his Happineſs to have read Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> when he wrote this, nor indeed had He, living in an obſcure quarter of the World, at that time heard of that learned work; Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi>'s came out ſince it was finiſhed; if this weak Attempt give any farther Light to any thing, or has touched on what was prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted by their greater Induſtry, it may add ſomewhat to the Tale, and <hi>Socinian ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Confidence</hi> may begin to ſhine with the more notorious Luſtre.</p>
            <p>He has inſiſted more largely on the General Practice of
<hi>Praying to our Saviour</hi> and make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him <hi>the Ultimate Object of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Adorations,</hi> and thinks he has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the impoſſibility of defending that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice on the ſuppoſition that our Saviour is no more than <hi>a meer Man,</hi> the Notion of a <hi>made God</hi> ridicules it ſelf, and no Conteſt fairer or more diverting can be ſet on foot than between an honeſt zealous Papiſt and a Socinian Reaſon-Monger concerning the Obligation of the firſt and ſecond Commandment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102432:8"/>That particular end of our Saviour's Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, viz. <hi>That He might deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> is perhaps no inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Evidence of his <hi>Superiority both to Angels and Men,</hi> The debate concerning the <hi>Abrogation of the Jewiſh Law</hi> evinces the ſame Truth, and by the common tracks of Sence and Reaſon, which the
<hi>Socinians</hi> pretend to appeal to, leads us to underſtand the neceſſity of our Saviour's being <hi>True and Eternal God as well as True Man,</hi> an inferiour Perſon could not have conſummated the Types, nor could <hi>a meer Man,</hi> however alledging a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commiſſion, have repealed what Almighty God himſelf had ſetled and commanded under the moſt terrible Penalties in the World.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, the Author proves the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our Lord's giving ſatisfaction to his Father's Juſtice for the ſins of mankind,</hi> and is Himſelf ſo fully convinced of it, that He takes it for granted Thoſe who reject it, either take <hi>Salvation</hi> in general for a fond <hi>Chimerical Whimſey,</hi> or would obtrude upon us ſome <hi>new and uncouth Idea of the Divine Nature,</hi> or think <hi>Mankind capable of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> in this Life and <hi>meriting Salvation</hi> for themſelves by their own <hi>ſupererogatory Sanctity.</hi> He generally turns their

            <p>IT'S our buſineſs and deſign for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of thoſe, who ſhall read this diſcourſe, from damnable Errors: for the glory of the eternal Son of God, whoſe Divinity we find boldly impeach'd and blaſphemouſly deny'd by a peſtilent crew of ſubtle and inſinuating Hereticks: for the confirmation of that Faith in Chriſt which we profeſs, and in which we hope to dye: to encounter ſeveral of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments thro' God's aſſiſtance, which thoſe enemies of Chriſtianity aſſault the World with. To which end, it will be abſolutely neceſſary to clear the ſenſe of theſe words from thoſe artificial clouds which ſome have endeavour'd to obſcure them with, and here we find the <hi>Socinians</hi> not ſo much diſputing about the meaning of the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
<hi>without controverſie great is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of godlineſs;</hi> as about the connexion of theſe words with the particulars follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For if they can prove that the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of God is no part or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102432:11"/> of our Faith, or no myſtery of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they deprive us of one of the beſt and plaineſt Texts of Scripture for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of his Divinity. Again, if they can ſo bafflle all myſteries in Religion, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be regarded but what can eaſily be comprehended by weak and corrupted reaſon, our holy Religion ſtands upon a lower ground than the wretched Syſtems of Pagan Divinity; and God muſt ſtand reprov'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he ſpeak any thing by inſpired Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which the meaneſt perſon cannot fully and clearly underſtand. In our entrance therefore on our intended diſcourſe, we muſt firſt remove theſe difficulties before we ſpeak to the particulars.</p>
            <p>And here we cannot but take notice that the <hi>Socinians</hi> generally profeſs abundance of reſpect for the Scriptures, and ſeem to take a great deal of pains to aſſert their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and it is upon the pretendedly genuine explication of that Word of God they build thoſe Heretical Opinions, with which they diſturb the Church. <hi>Socinus</hi> makes it a ſtrange thing that any man profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſhould make any doubt of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the books of the Old and New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Socin.</hi> de author.

               </note> eſpecially the laſt, ſince the Writers of it were men of reputation and exactly acquainted with thoſe things they writ about; ſince the Writers were very well known, ſince the books themſelves are not corrupted or depraved, and becauſe <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102432:11"/> there are no full or clear teſtimonies to be found that thoſe books deſerve not that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit we commonly give them.<note place="margin">Catech.

               </note> it had been impoſſible they ſhould all have conſpired in the ſame read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and therefore we may obſerve where the leaſt change has been made, the Copies diſagree. In this obſervation we cloſe with them, and by their own rule the better anſwer their cavil with this Text.</p>

               <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> indeed tells ſuch a ſtory in his abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it's ſo impertinent, that even <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> himſelf concludes he was miſtaken in it, and we may go farther and pronounce it wholly falſe, ſince a Manuſcript Copy of the new Teſtament preſented to <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt of bleſſed memory, by <hi>Cyrill</hi> then Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> reads, as we do at this day: and that Copy being about 1300 years old, was written long before the latter
<hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was born: ſo that there was no need of running himſelf into danger by inſerting that word into St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Text which was there before; the <hi>Socinians,</hi> tho' daring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to impoſe upon the world, could not but ſee the abſurdity of their own pretence: therefore they try to weaken the force of this Text by another artifice.</p>
            <p>For ſo they tell us, that allowing the word <hi>God</hi> in the Text, it's not to be underſtood of Jeſus Chriſt, but of God the Father; and in this they have <hi>Grotius,</hi> tho' at a diſtance, their Leader too, who gives us this general interpretation of the Verſe: We are not here concern'd about any ordinary truth, but about that part of it, which no man of himſelf was able to make out, which has an extraordinary faculty to generate true piety in our hearts,<note place="margin">vid. Grot. in locum.</note> a part of truth in compariſon of which all the Precepts and Principles of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102432:15"/> the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law and of Philoſophy are idle and of no effect, and this myſterious truth amounts to this, That the Goſpel was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed not by Angels, but by poor, infirm and inconſiderable men, as our Lord and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſeem'd to the World; ſo the great myſtery was manifeſt in the fleſh: this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was juſtified in the ſpirit,
<hi>i. e.</hi> it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to the World by many Miracles, theſe being wrought by the influence of the ſpirit: it was ſeen of Angels, and that with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt admiration, for Angels came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpel by the means of Men; it was preacht to the Gentiles, not only to the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who before were God's peculiar people, but to the Gentiles who were meer ſtrangers to the true God; it was believ'd on in the World, a great part of Mankind entertaining it, and it was receiv'd up in glory, <hi>i e.</hi> it was exalted very gloriouſly, becauſe it introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a far greater degree of Holineſs into the World than any former Opinions did. So much pains did that learned man take to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure a plain Text of Scripture, and his gloſs upon it was but impertinent and abſurd at laſt. He's mighty willing to let the Verſe paſs without that emphatical word in it, but his fancy about the Goſpel's being manifeſt in the fleſh, and ſeen of Angels, being juſtified in the Spirit and receiv'd up into glory, are ſo poor and dilute, as became not a man of learning and ſenſe to obtrude upon the world: therefore his <hi>Socinian</hi> followers, tho' they <pb n="11" facs="tcp:102432:15"/> touch upon this gloſs of his; yet they quit the Goſpel, which he inſiſts upon, and take God the Father in its room. So <hi>Volkelius</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
<hi>Deum Patrem in carne manifeſtatum fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe intelligendum eſſe,</hi> that by the Text we are to underſtand that God the Father was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the fleſh, and purſues that aſſertion with this Paraphraſe of the whole, That God by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who ſuffer'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things on that account, did more clearly then ever diſcover himſelf and his will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to all precedent Ages. In the mean time tho' he reveal'd theſe things by inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable men, he took care by that divine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer he ſhew'd in them, to evidence his own juſtice and truth, and to have his will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd: that at that time and not ſooner, this will of his was known and underſtood by the very Angels, and the extraordinary wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God which ſhines in it, lay open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; that this ſame will of God was preach'd to foreign Nations unacquainted with him before, and deſtitute of divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;<note place="margin">vid.

<hi>Voſſius,</hi> as us'd by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Writers, it's generally taken for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things incomprehenſible by the light of nature, tho' ſometimes it has a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd ſignification relating to Symbolical rites; and ſo the two Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper are frequently call'd myſteries: but in the Text where we are told the myſtery of Godlineſs is great, and that aſſertion prov'd by the following particulars, we learn that the whole affair of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the bleſſed Jeſus with its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102432:16"/> by which the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from the ſlavery of ſin and death was effected, is a deep and profound myſtery, or ſecret, not to be comprehended by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtanding, and yet ſo neceſſarily to be believ'd, that no man can rightly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the name of Chriſtian, or pretend to give a due credit to the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, without embracing and fully belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it.</p>
            <p>But here we lie open again to the inſults of our
<hi>Socinian</hi> adverſaries, for they ſeem very unwilling to allow any ſuch things at preſent as myſteries in Religion: for tho' they do believe there were in former ages, as particularly before our Saviour's time, many things tending to humane ſalvation, which yet to humane underſtandings were inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and never to be found out; yet theſe things are now reveal'd, and conſequently comprehenſible enough by ſound reaſon, and certainly to be fathomed by diſcourſe and ſenſe. Thus <hi>Schlicktingius</hi> in his diſputation againſt the Doctrine of the Trinity, oppos'd to

And ſo ſoon as ever our reaſon has paſs'd a true and uncorrupt judgment upon them, it always finds thoſe myſteries to be very true. Thus He. Elſewhere he aſſerts, that our ignorance of divine myſteries proceeds not from the corruption of our nature through the fall of Man, but from the extraordinary ſublime nature of thoſe Myſteries;<note place="margin">Disput. pro Socino. p. <hi>101. 1</hi> Cor.
<hi>15.51.</hi> De verâ Relig. l. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>344.</hi>
               </note> and therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are once reveal'd to us, whether by God's word or by his Spirit, <hi>Tantas habemus vires, ut eas animo comprehendere valeamus,</hi> we have ſo much ſtrength of mind that we are able to comprehend them. The ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he preaches in his Commentary on that of the Apoſtle, Behold I ſhew you a myſtery; and <hi>Crellius</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame effect. But this reaſoning is not ſuch as ſhould make us much admire our own faculties with reſpect to the myſteries of Religion: It's true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our reaſon may ſerve us ſo far as to convince us ſuch or ſuch a truth is reveal'd, our eye ſees it in that Book which we call the word of God, our ear hears it; therefore by diſcourſe we conclude that that Truth ſtands ſo reveal'd there, and our reaſon enables us to judge whether the revelation be authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <pb n="15" facs="tcp:102432:17"/> and fit for us to depend on or no. But according to their acknowledgment, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man involv'd in ſin, could with all his wit and ſenſe diſcover no remedy for his miſery, the more he diſcours'd with himſelf, the more plainly he'd find, that He who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended a Being wiſe, knowing, and powerful to puniſh, could rationally expect nothing but puniſhment from one ſo offended: Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy could take little place in Man's thoughts in the caſe; he could ſee reaſons enough why he ſhould be puniſh'd for his ſin, but no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he ſhould be pardon'd, ſince he had ſinn'd: God now had decreed a remedy for him, but God's decree was ſecret and indiſcoverable. As man could not naturally feed himſelf with any reaſonable hopes that ſuch a remedy ſhould be: neither could he contrive how that remedy ſhould be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or by what means he an offender ſhould eſcape the ſtroke of Juſtice; ſince Mercy as well as juſtice muſt have ſome ground or reaſon to move upon: the means then as well as the decree was hitherto myſterious. Well, Almighty God in his wonderful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration of humane weakneſs was pleas'd to promiſe ſomewhat comfortable to our firſt parents, in the ſtrength of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe they were enabled to live, tho' under the weight of thoſe calamities ſin had laid them open to: God afterwards beſides theſe extraordinary promiſes of the ſame nature made to the Patriarchs, inſpired ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <pb n="16" facs="tcp:102432:18"/> holy Men, who ſpake as influenced by him, and they foretold man's redemption by a Meſſias, one that ſhould be Anointed to that purpoſe. Here then the myſtery was reveal'd, and what man before could not rationally have hoped for, he was now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of by God himſelf. But did not the whole matter continue a Myſtery ſtill? Nay, was not the Myſtery now more inſcrutable than before? Could Man give a reaſon, or comprehend the matter in his Soul, why an exceedingly provoked God ſhould expreſs ſuch love or pity for thoſe who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him? If they could have done ſo, they might have done it as well before, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently have concluded, that tho' they had incenſed God, yet his wrath would certainly be atoned, and therefore there was no need of a Revelation: or after this Revelation, could Man tell certainly what the meaning of this Meſſiah was? They ſaw him ſometimes deſcribed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets under all the glorious characters of a mighty King, nay, equall'd with God himſelf in his titles and in his name. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſaw him character'd as very mean and contemptible, as riding on an Aſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a triumphant Chariot, as one who had no form nor comlineſs in him, no beauty for which he ſhould be deſired, nay, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief. Could common reaſon ſo eaſily diſcover what manner of <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102432:18"/> perſon he ſhould be in whom theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars ſo ſeemingly contradictory ſhould meet? If ſo, what made the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had enjoyed a greater portion of divine light than the reſt of the World, what made them ſtumble ſo extreamly at the perſon of the Meſſias when he appear'd, or think it ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reconcile Prophecies ſo ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradictory to one another? were the <hi>Jews</hi> the only perſons utterly deſerted by reaſon, or grown brutes on the ſuddain? What ſhall we ſay to the exiſtence of a God, one ſupream Being who manages all things? That there is a God, tho' the Socinians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, Nature, and the various works of the Creation teach us; for reaſon will perſwade us that the Apoſtle ſpeaks plain enough to that purpoſe, when he makes it a reaſon why the Heathens ſhould be inexcuſable, becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God has ſhewed it unto them, for the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19.20.</note> being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: This ſame exiſtence of a God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to us in Scripture, but in the mean time we muſt own that by Scripture we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally know no more of God than Nature and the works of Nature had diſcover'd before: for that which may be known of God was viſible in them as the forecited Text in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us; nay, had not Nature impreſt upon <pb n="18" facs="tcp:102432:19"/> our Souls ſome Idaeas of the divinity, had not we been able to read his eternal power and Godhead in them, all the revelations in Scripture would have appear'd very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and unſatisfactory, ſince all the diſcourſe in it concerning God might eaſily have been interpreted into a religious ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contriv'd meerly to get reputation to that Book of which God was the pretended Author. But after Nature and revelation have done ſo much, are we able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the nature of the Almighty? is not every thing that bears the character of infinity dark and myſterious ſtill? we know God is, we know that he is a rewarder of thoſe who diligently ſeek him, but can we tell by what methods his prudence manages the univerſe? can we tell how he is infinitely wiſe, juſt, good, merciful, true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or tho' we know God is ſo, can we tell what it is to be ſo? No, we know the poſitive part, but for us to go farther would argue us Gods and not men: But does the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of a certain truth that was my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious, change its nature? is not that which was a myſtery before, a myſtery ſtill? The Chriſtian Religion or the Principles on which it was built were once myſterious, a <hi>Socinian</hi> will aſſert, they were ſo before Chriſt's coming into the world: but, if we may give any credit to our Apoſtle who wrote after the Aſcenſion of our Saviour into Heaven, the myſtery of Godlineſs is <pb n="19" facs="tcp:102432:19"/> great ſtill, and it will continue ſo as long as Heaven and Earth endure? But here for our better procedure in countermining the <hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſies, it will be neceſſary briefly to diſcuſs that queſtion how far humane reaſon is to take place in matters of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: For <hi>Smalcius</hi> tells us poſitively,<note place="margin">Smale.

It's that whereby he is able to diſtinguiſh between things, to judge of what tends to his own happineſs, and what may any way be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to it. It's that whereby Man comes to ſee God in his Creatures, from the frame and contexture and management of which he underſtands the wiſdom and power of him that made them, and to obſerve his own dependence upon that Almighty Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. <pb n="20" facs="tcp:102432:20"/> It enables him to argue from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon himſelf concerning the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy of God, and how fit it is for all created Beings to adore and magnifie the Creator. It ſhews how fit it is that thoſe who ſo intirely depend upon him ſhould devote all their ſervices to him, how they ſhould all ſeek to him in every diſtreſs, and worſhip him, ſo as may be acceptable to him. When I give humane reaſon ſo high a character, I underſtand it only as imparted to him in his firſt Creation, when he was equally clothed with native beauty and innocence, his diſcurſive faculty was then ſo high and clear, that we, miſerable creatures, have at preſent only ſome poor defective glimpſes of it; or we ſee it like ſome glorious light indeed, but fix'd at ſo prodigious a diſtance, that we cannot with all our preſent skill take it's true magnitude. As it was then, it fitted Man for that mighty Sovereignty over the inferiour parts of the Creation, which he was then inveſted with; it taught him to cultivate the garden of the Lord, ſo as became a faithful Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Servant; It gave him ſuch a view of the Divine Nature, that nothing could poſſibly ſeem more abſurd or ſhameful, than any thing he could do that might offend God. And ſo true an inſight into that which we call Natural Philoſophy, that the nature of every creature was obvious to him at firſt, and he capable of naming all things <pb n="21" facs="tcp:102432:20"/> according to that nature. So that it was really not a want of reaſon which made him ſink under the temptations of Hell, but it was careleſneſs, not ſtanding duly upon his guard, nor adverting ſeriouſly to the tenour of what was offer'd. He had the weapon, but he made no due uſe of it: he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted indeed in a ſtate of perfection, but his paſſions and affections were alterable, his body paſſible, nay, his reaſon it ſelf capable of a countermine when the deſign of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition center'd in a being created to as great advantages as himſelf. And when parties of equal ſtrength and courage are engaged in a contention, the firſt that's guilty of an inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency muſt certainly be foil'd; had not love and beauty like the pipe of <hi>Mercury,</hi> lull'd the hundred eyes of original reaſon into a fatal ſleep, death could never have found entrance into the world, nor ſin have been the dreadful harbinger of its ruines. But we ſee Sin and Death have over-power'd and prevail every day more and more upon us without any conſiderable oppoſition, which had reaſon retain'd its primeval vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, it would certainly have met with, therefore we conclude,</p>

               <hi>That reaſon stands now extreamly impair'd by the fall of man, and in a great meaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitated for proſecuting thoſe noble ends for which at firſt it was beſtow'd.</hi> It's true, reaſon is the very form of the Soul, the Soul it ſelf <pb n="22" facs="tcp:102432:21"/> a ſubſtance pure, immaterial, Divine, but it's immerſt in a body of a groſſer nature, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized indeed originally exactly for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and every way fit to be actuated by it, and by vertue of that exact preparation of its ſubject, it moved originally with eaſe and freedom: but forms may admit of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſin has effected ſuch an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Soul, it has not quite extinguiſh'd that candle of the Lord, but it has made it burn very dim and uncertainly; it has not entirely ſeparated reaſon from the Soul, but it has made it ſlow and unactive, or elſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perverſly active; and whereas the body was exactly fit at firſt for the operations of an unpolluted Soul, that body it ſelf is much diſordered now, and even where the Soul would act better, it finds it ſelf oppreſſed with that body of Death which ſin has loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it with: that Death as its preparative has thouſands of diſeaſes and diſtempers, many of which extreamly impair that little reaſon we are ſtill poſſeſt of, not that the Soul is immediately prejudiced in it ſelf by them, but as the curious Artiſt can yet do nothing without his tools, ſo the Soul moves, heavily becauſe the body is wholly unfitted for its exerting its activity: and ſo farther as we obſerve the Artiſan's work is worſe or better according to the excellency of his tools, ſo daily experience teaches us, the mind applies it ſelf more nimbly to work, is more curious in its fancy, more large and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102432:21"/> various in its inventions, more calm and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in its judgment, according to the temper and conſtitution of that body it reſides in. Hence we conclude that thoſe we call Ideots or Fools have Souls immortal and rational as well as our ſelves, but thoſe Souls have no proper organs to demonſtrate their innate reaſon by: theſe unhappineſſes are all the fatal conſequences of ſin, and we could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that ſin had had any ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences at all, had not reaſon ſuffer'd by it: for if we can, as really we do, obſerve, that reaſon teaches every one who now adverts ſeriouſly to it, to aim at quiet and happineſs; ſo had not ſin clouded it ſtrangely, it had been impoſſible any temptation whatſoever contrived by Hell or its emiſſaries could have baffled it. But it's plain that by our preſent incapacities to anſwer the ſophiſtry of the tempter, we are continually betray'd to ſin: reaſon in its height and purity would have convinced us of the madneſs and folly of every thing that's ill, reaſon as it now ſtands perverted ſuffers us, unleſs prevented with a great deal of induſtry, to embrace ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of good, and it's no ſmall argument of a great weakneſs in our ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal faculties to be ſo impos'd on: We often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times now entertain our capital adverſary the Devil as an angel of light, we miſpriſe vice for virtue, falſhood for truth, ſophiſtry for ſolid arguments, novelty for antiquity, ſuperſtition for devotion, noiſe for ſenſe, <pb n="24" facs="tcp:102432:22"/> intereſt for zeal, confidence for great parts and ingenuity: and reaſon it ſelf as now it ſtands, when we have a few lucid intervals, ſhews us the extreme ridiculouſneſs of thoſe miſtakes, and the abilities which ſome have to expoſe the follies of others, and at the ſame time to betray their own, is unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable evidence of the imbecillity of humane reaſon in general. It's doubtleſs poſſible for ſome of excellent conſtitutions to argue themſelves into a ſtrong perſwaſion that there is a <hi>God.</hi> It's again poſſible, nay we ſee it too too common for men of delicate intellectuals to pretend to anſwer all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought to prove the being of a <hi>God,</hi> and they do it ſo plauſibly, as to get proſelytes, and to make abundance of room for horrid Atheiſm. We make no queſtion but that we have proofs really unanſwerable of the Divinity of the Son of God; the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> with whom we are now concern'd, deny it, and pretend to demonſtrations of the contrary, and all from principles of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Scriptures rationally interpreted; and many well meaning men think they are in the right, and therefore cloſe with them: Theſe oppoſitions of Reaſon could never have happen'd, had the Soul or mind enjoy'd its original freedom and activity; for nothing could poſſibly have been offer'd in oppoſition to reaſon wholly clear and perfect, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been incapable of ſtooping to mean arts and trifling ſophiſtry. But we need indeed <pb n="25" facs="tcp:102432:22"/> no more but to reflect a little on our firſt Parents, and on our ſelves, to prove the truth of this concluſion. It's impoſſible to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the prodigious difference there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Adam</hi> as a knowing Monarch, giving names to all Creatures according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and <hi>Adam</hi> ſowing Fig-leaves together to hide his nakedneſs from Creatures whom ſome conclude irrational; and flying to the ſhelter of the Trees of <hi>Eden</hi> for a ſecurity from the preſence of an all-ſeeing God; one argued exceſs of wiſdom, the other the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of folly: and for our ſelves, as the <hi>Jews</hi> proved themſelves dull and ſenſeleſs, who could not be convinced or reduced by him, who ſpake as never man ſpake; ſo we cannot without extreme difficulty find any impreſſions of good made on our Souls by the moſt forcible diſcourſes: whereas reaſon in its primitive glory could admit of nothing, but what was holy, juſt and good; all this notwithſtanding we conclude,</p>

               <hi>That Humane reaſon corrupted as it is, has yet ſo much of light and strength, as to ſhew and convince us of a general neceſſity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> This we aſſert of the light of nature, which really is nothing but meer reaſon, as it ſtands at preſent affected. Now if the works of nature are ſuch, as according to the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle, do evidence the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's power and Godhead, this evidence muſt be clear to ſomewhat that's able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102432:23"/> it; and if it be ſo very full and plain, that they who neglect it are altogether inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, then that reaſon which we now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, which alone is capable of apprehending natural evidence, muſt ſtill have that ſtrength that thoſe who by its conduct cannot find out a
<hi>God,</hi> and their general duty to him, are therefore not to be excus'd. God has made the World, and all things therein, and gives to all life and breath,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24, 25, 26, 27.</note> and all things, and has made of one blood all Nations to dwell upon the Earth, that they might ſeek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him and find him: but it would have been very ill argued of the Apoſtle from ſuch Topicks, if ſuch obſervations had not really been enough to guide thoſe who ſearch after God to make a diſcovery of him. And here the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſeem to act by very ſtrange meaſures, they conclude as before I obſerv'd from
<hi>Smalcius,</hi> that there's nothing to be admitted into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but what's agreeable to reaſon; but we cannot tell what's agreeable to reaſon, unleſs we can fully and clearly comprehend it: for otherwiſe we may be miſtaken, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that agreeable to reaſon, which really is not ſo. But at the ſame time, <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf looks upon the light of nature as not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to impreſs on Man the notion of a

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102432:23"/> learned of his followers and defenders, goes about in his Book <hi>de Deo &amp; ejus attributis,</hi> to demonſtrate the being of a

<hi>God,</hi> ſuch a demonſtration is extremely impertinent.
<hi>Socinus</hi> would prove his opinion among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things by that of the Apoſtle, He that comes to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him, which is prefaced with that: That without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</note> But this is no proof at all, for Men may by conſidering circumſtances come to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of ſome ſupreme power; and yet never believe in him, nor ever own or practiſe their duty to him: and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice of ſome <hi>holding the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> who when they knew <hi>God,</hi> glorified him not as <hi>God:</hi> tho' they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his exiſtence, they were not careful to perform the duty of Creatures or ſervants to a Supreme Creator; they were not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but became vain in their Imaginations,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21.</note> and their fooliſh hearts were darkned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now thoſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> there reflects on were Heathens in general, who being under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of believing that there was a <hi>God</hi> by rational diſcourſe, yet out of a ſupine lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, troubled not themſelves to improve rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo far as they might and ought to have done; and therefore, without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102432:24"/> of the divine Nature, fell to worſhip Idols, or to reſpect the Creature more than the Creator; yet even that Idolatry it ſelf is an uncontroulable evidence of the general notion of God's exiſtence, ſince no man poſſibly could be drawn to adore ſeveral, if he really believ'd there were no God at all. Nor farther does it follow, that becauſe I'm ſatisfied there is a God, therefore I muſt neceſſarily be acceptable to God; for tho' my ſence of his Divinity may of it ſelf be pleaſing to my Maker, yet if that ſence have no operation upon my life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my continuance in ſin muſt cancel all thoſe advantages I could hope to receive upon an inevitable conviction.

The man that ſeeks to improve his reaſon by reading, in ſearch of books muſt act very irrationally if he pretermit the Book of God; For he that believes there is a God, and takes him for a Being infinitely ſuperiour to himſelf, when he thinks it worth his while to converſe with humane writings, cannot but judge it much more ſo to examine a book which carries the name of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as its Author in the frontiſpiece: Hee'd read it, tho' it were to no other end, but to find whether it were agreeable to that auguſt title it bore, and what real characters of the Divinity were to be found in it. But when ſuch a man comes once to read it ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, tho' he's not able to comprehend all he reads, yet his rational faculty muſt run very low if he find not more improvements of it there than in all other writings whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

So when Men in conſulting Scriptures, eſpecially at firſt, find their Souls diſturb'd under a ſence of former ignorance, and meet with advices in that ſacred book ſufficient to extricate themſelves out of that perplexity; promiſes of the true God's readineſs to hear and to aſſiſt thoſe who deſire to know him, occur frequently too: as particularly that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the old Teſtament,<note place="margin">

Reaſon is certainly a talent beſtowed upon us, not to lay it up in a napkin, but to uſe and to make
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102432:29"/> the beſt of it. Had ſuch a Book as Scripture been deliver'd to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, I make no queſtion, but it would have been in every point intelligible to him: as things ſtand now we may and ought to exerciſe our reaſon about it, but not ſo as to limit Scripture by our reaſon, but to limit our reaſon by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. It's true, Scripture may by meer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be prov'd to be the Word of God, but that operation is very ſlow, and requires a very unuſual application; therefore God in the infancy both of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and Chriſtian Church made uſe of Miracles to work more ſtrongly and ſwiftly upon the Soul, not that he deſign'd to ſuperſede our reaſon, but to quicken it and to ſet it ſo much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly on work, and withall, by a redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it to an acknowledgment of its own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, to make it ſubmit the more entirely to him whoſe power was able ſo far to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach its utmoſt capacity; Miracles were the common objects of Mens ſenſes, and indeed appeals to them: and when the <hi>Jews</hi> had known a Man from his Child-hood that was born blind, and when they ſaw him about forty years of age bleſt with ſight, they had no reaſon to diſtruſt the truth of that, of which they every moment ſaw the effects; where there was lodged a power ſufficient

But after all, as reaſon could not poſſibly give an account of the manner of working ſo ſenſible a miracle, but by reſolving all into omnipotence, nor was it neceſſary it ſhould: ſo neither was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reaſon ſhould comprehend every thing that was ſpoken by God, and yet it lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of believing every thing true that's ſo ſpoken, and that again upon a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional principle, <hi>viz.</hi> that He who ſpeaks, being
<hi>God,</hi> can neither deceive nor be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But as thoſe who engage themſelves in the ſtudy of any particular Science, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand but little at firſt of its reaſon, but by aſſiduity and diligence come to ſee throughly into it; ſo it is in matters of religion, he that's but a Babe can bear no ſtronger nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment than milk, he that's ſtronger can digeſt ſubſtantial meats, <hi>i. e.</hi> the beginner in thoſe ſtudies muſt pretend to nothing farther than what's very plain and eaſie; but when by continual meditation be has made thoſe plain things familiar to him, there will ſome conſequences offer themſelves, not ſo plain, but every whit as true as the firſt principles, and that reaſon which at firſt was ready to ſtumble at the moſt obvious noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will afterwards digeſt thoſe at a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſtance, and be as ſtrongly convinced of <pb n="41" facs="tcp:102432:30"/> them as of the former; but in the chain of conſequences ſomewhat will occur at laſt beyond the reach of the largeſt unbeatified Soul. Thus that Man is naturally miſerable. is a truth undeniable by reaſon of our every days experience, natures light has confirm'd the World in the truth; yet Man is very apt to ſtumble and perplex himſelf at the occaſion and ground of his being ſo: doubts ariſe in the caſe from ſome weak reflections upon God's juſtice and goodneſs; yet its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally believ'd, and the reading of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture farther confirms the truth; that Man, miſerable as he is, making uſe of ſuch and ſuch means, may be happy, is a truth reveal'd, and without revelation imperceptible; yet now its once reveal'd, reaſon can properly argue, that the ſame things or qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which would have ſecur'd happineſs to Man at firſt, muſt do ſo now, and the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Innocence, was that original mean, Innocence the indiſpenſible qualification; But reaſon proves again that that primitive Innocence is really unattainable now, and it will proceed thus far further, that either there muſt be ſome way diſcover'd to make up that unhappy defect, or elſe Man muſt ſink in his natural miſery, and all the care he can take to prevent it will do him no ſervice: here divine revelation goes along with him too, and what reaſon, as now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, could never have dream't of, we have a revelation relating to the making up <pb n="42" facs="tcp:102432:31"/> of this defect, and that by the Incarnation and Paſſion of the Son of God, but there Faith reſts upon Revelation alone, and gets no aſſiſtance at all from reaſon, but only from that diſtant principle, that the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler cannot deceive nor be deceived: reaſon can come no nearer, nor can it judge of the revelation by any other principle, yet the Man who believes not this, how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he can underſtand of it, is in a ſtate of damnation. The wonderful wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Almighty God appears in this, as acting in the moſt difficult caſe and in the kindeſt manner, but to ſuppoſe the wiſdom and the goodneſs of God in ſo prodigious effects ſhould not ſurpaſs our diſcurſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, is abſurd, as reducing divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to humane rules; but it never can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming to an ordinary Chriſtian to expreſs himſelf in theſe things, as the Apoſtle does in what relates to them, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God!</hi>

So our Natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was clear and free at firſt, common oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences needed no deep meditations, nor extraordinary paſſages any tedious ſtudy to <pb n="48" facs="tcp:102432:34"/> apprehend them in every circumſtance. The caſe is now otherwiſe, our reaſon buſies it ſelf naturally about trifles, and onely puzles and perplexes it ſelf in matters of no weight or moment; yet ſtill it may move to good purpoſe, but it requires abundance of care and pains to cultivate it ſo, as it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing that's good; and even with a great deal of pains too, ſometimes it makes concluſions onely vain, troubleſome and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably falſe: this unhappineſs is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our own follies at firſt, and it's God's unmerited goodneſs, that we can yet by making uſe of due means diſtinguiſh in ſome meaſure between truth and falſhood, at leaſt in the more obvious parts of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and his goodneſs yet appears farther, in that where our decrepit reaſon fails, he's pleas'd to interpoſe with the influences of his bleſſed Spirit, and to preſerve the Modeſt and Humble from falling into damnable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: that our Reaſon may have a ſubject profitable to employ it ſelf upon, God has given us his Word, <hi>bleſſed are they who meditate on that word day and night:</hi> he calls upon us to apply our ſelves to the Law and to the teſtimony, to ſearch the Scriptures, to ſearch them with the ſame care and diligence as thoſe who work in Mines ſeek for the golden Ore. Whereas he lays in his Word ſeveral Commands upon us; He would have us examine them ſo as we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they are not grievous, but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="49" facs="tcp:102432:34"/> juſt and good: Theſe Commandments therefore muſt be examin'd by the rule of right Reaſon, which whoſoever follows, will be infinitely ſatisfied in them. In his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with mankind he calls upon them to examine their own ways, by the ſame rule he enters into arguments highly rational with mankind himſelf, he bids them to judge in their own cauſes between himſelf and them, and ſee if diſcuſſing things ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, they muſt not neceſſarily fall upon that confeſſion, That God's ways are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, but the ways of men unequal. When he recommends his mercies, when he would terrifie with his judgments, He appeals to Humane Reaſon ſtill, or that ſhare of light which we are now partakers of. Now he that will employ that light he has upon ſuch noble ſubjects, if he be not prejudiced with wicked principles before, or puff'd up with ſelf-conceit, muſt neceſſarily be a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man; for, the clearer any mans ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional faculty is, the more pious he muſt be; only men of very low abilities can be either Atheiſts or Hereticks. It's confeſt indeed ſome Hereticks, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, with whom we are at preſent concern'd, pretend highly to Reaſon, but they only ſham us with fond pretences, and their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is all empty and ſophiſtical; and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts are the Men of ſence, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve fools and madmen: but there is a vaſt difference between a flaſhy Wit and a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing <pb n="50" facs="tcp:102432:35"/> Humour, and ſound judgment, and ſolid and weighty argument. But God who knew before what artifices Hell and wicked men would make uſe of to pervert truth, calls upon us to exerciſe our reaſon farther, in diſcovering and baffling thoſe cheats the enemies of our Souls would fain put upon us, wherein, as Hereticks and Schiſmaticks generally make their appeals to God's Word, and we have warning in that very Word, That in thoſe doctrines where there's any ſhew of difficulty, thoſe who are unlearned and unſtable wreſt the Scriptures to their own deſtructions: We are warn'd to try the Spirits whether they be of God; and Scripture being the rule of tryal, we are oblig'd to ſtudy the true ſence and meaning of that. To which end our rational faculty carries us along in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the original Languages, in which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was written, and finding out the true meaning and import of words and phraſes in other authors, and the modes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of countries to which any Texts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Reaſon goes with us in comparing text with text, and matters of faith or practice laid down in one place with thoſe laid down in another, in obſerving the force of thoſe arguments drawn from ſuch and ſuch Texts, their real dependance upon or direct conſequence from the places alledg'd, and the general conſiſtency of opinions offer'd with the end and deſign of thoſe poſitive
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102432:35"/> truths laid down in Scripture, Reaſon has here a large field to exerciſe it ſelf in. And whereas we are urg'd by ſome to abjure that utterly with reſpect to thoſe points of faith or practice that are under debate, pretending they'd inſiſt only on the letter of Scripture,
<hi>Maximus</hi> tells us well in the formerly cited diſcourſe of his,

               </note> but diſſwading it indeed that they might avoid the reproof of their Errors from thence: where he takes farther notice, how ſuch perſons if they meet but with a word that at firſt hearing ſounds favourably to their fancies, they run away with it without ever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the deſign of the inſpired Writer, or examining the agreement of their own ſhallow gloſſes with the general tenour of Holy Writ: an humour that prevails with too many ſtill, who prefer the ſound of words before the truth and pertinency of texts of Scripture; and therefore imagine themſelves to argue very piouſly and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to God's word, when all their talk is nothing to the purpoſe. But myſteries, the great myſteries of Religion are reveal'd in Scripture: it proves God's goodneſs yet farther, he has by that means given Reaſon a task proper for its exerciſe. For tho' our <pb n="52" facs="tcp:102432:36"/> Reaſon be not able to fathom all the depths of thoſe mighty revelations; yet as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts ſeeking after their great <hi>Arcanum,</hi> tho' they miſs the main deſign, yet by the way they make a thouſand uſeful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, never otherwiſe to have been found out. So thoſe who take due meaſures, and induſtriouſly inſiſt in the ſearching the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of myſteries in Religion; though they can never in this life reach their utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yet they attain many things in their queſt, of a very uſeful and a very comfortable kind. Thus we ſee the Weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Viſions of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the whole book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> have given abundance of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to the beſt and wiſeſt Chriſtians, who yet have never been able to come to any conſiderable agreement in the Interpretation of them; yet the learned labours of many have been ſo far from loſt, that many excellent truths have been fully clear'd, many pious Souls wonderfully ſupported, and many controverſies happily reſolv'd to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and edification of the Church of God. And we have found plainly that ſome have ſeen into thoſe myſtical ſecrets much more clearly than others, which argues their quicker apprehenſions, and their more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſiſtances in their ſtudies, and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al a great encouragement to others to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the ſame ſtudies with patience; ſince tho' their progreſs is not great, it may be ſure, where ſomething is attained to, more <pb n="53" facs="tcp:102432:36"/> may be; and we believe it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon that the author of the

But it would be no ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bleſſing for a man to read a book, of which he could hope to underſtand nothing at all; and it would be no great evidence of a man's extraordinary wiſdom, to ſpend his time in poring after the interpretation of a myſtic number, and to find out to whom it belong'd, if the whole was never deſign'd to be in the leaſt intelligible. No, God never ſet man at work in any inquiry, but he intended the profit ſhould at leaſt be worth the pains. It muſt be confeſt that what <hi>Schlicktingius</hi> aſſerts is very true, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetae novi Teſtamenti, Chriſto jam exorto,

And the predictions of future things in the New Teſtament are expreſs'd in plain words: plain words may expreſs very hard matters, and there's no need of uncouth Hyperboles, or aenigmatical or ambiguous expreſſions to make a thing myſterious. Our Saviour preach'd in as plain a manner as ever any did or could; yet how did the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi>

This very comparing of predictions with events would require no ſmall intention of our rational faculties; yet here he owns theſe Viſions and repreſentations to be my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious ſo long till the event unriddle them. And there's no truth of ſo profound a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no expreſſion in Scripture ſo difficult, but that futurity will make it all plain and delightfully intelligible to the Souls
<hi>of juſt men made perfect:</hi> yet here's conſtant work for the ſoundeſt head, and the more ſuch a one diſcovers of the myſteries of Religion, the more he'll be ſenſible of the defects of his own underſtanding, and he'll find the more reaſon to bleſs the name of God who has yet continued to him the ruines of a compleat underſtanding: and given him ſuch ſubjects to exerciſe it upon as may gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually raiſe it towards its original ſtrength, till heavens glory gives it a conſummate perfection.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102432:39"/> has laid down, or methodiz'd in his thoughts, to be ſo very plain and clear, that it's impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible any man of ſenſe ſhould not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be his proſelyte; and ſome perhaps are ready to flatter ſuch a one in his over-ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceit, by a pretended concurrence in their ſentiments with him: after all, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens as often, that another of as great natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abilities, and as ſearching a head, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a great many miſtakes in the others beautiful Scheme of thoughts, and baffles the whole invention the other had admired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for: ſuch things ought to make all, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in religious matters, where it's dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous jeſting or innovating, to act with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of circumſpection; and indeed rather to confine themſelves to lower ſtudies than to hazard the over-ſetting their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals, by engaging into boundleſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.

God has laid open ſuch infinite treaſures of Divine wiſdom before us, and our underſtandings are ſo very ſhort, that we need not look out ſtrange ſubjects of our meditations, it's enough if we can in ſome tolerable manner comprehend thoſe ſacred truths that are deliver'd to us: and we are more concern'd to endeavour to do ſo, than ſome are ready to imagine. For though a <hi>Socinian</hi> may tell us, God has declared ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things in holy Scripture, that are no way neceſſary to Salvation, the aſſertion is abſurd and falſe; that old Axiome, <hi>Deus &amp; Natura nihil faciunt fruſtra,</hi> That God and Nature never do any thing in vain is enough to refute it: for ſince the end of Scripture is the making Men wiſe to ſalvation, it's very bold to ſay God knew not how to frame ſuch a Book, without abundance of impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, when we ſee many Men, ſetting much ſlighter ends before themſelves, will yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute their diſcourſes in ſo cloſe and exact a manner, that the moſt critical judgment may perhaps find what to add, but cannot find what to take away from their writings; there is therefore no poſitive truth aſſerted in holy Writ, but what is really uſeful to Man's Salvation, ſince there's nothing throughout the whole, but what ſerves to illuſtrate God's goodneſs, and mercy, and truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Man's miſery by Sin, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by Grace, or lays down rules of life <pb n="60" facs="tcp:102432:40"/> and practice, or gives us examples of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or Vices in others, from all which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very inſtructive may be drawn; nor can we believe that even the genealogical Tables in <hi>Scripture were,</hi> as a late Writer impudently ſuggeſts, <hi>deſign'd onely to amuſe and confound us,</hi> but to ſet us in a way to find how all the ancient Prophecies centred in Jeſus Chriſt, the promiſed Meſſias. As the poſitive aſſertions, ſo their true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine conſequences are in ſome ſort, and to ſome Men neceſſary to ſalvation, God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given greater capacities, and larger Souls to ſome than he has to others, expects proportionable improvements from them, and a Man of wiſdom and learning cannot be ſaved onely on the ſame terms on which a perſon of low and mean endowments may; therefore thoſe of greater parts are bound to look into every thing divinely reveal'd, and to what may be regularly deduced from it; but as perfection in good works is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in every one that is to be ſaved, and yet many are ſav'd, tho' none are perfectly good; ſo it is in relation to things contain'd in Scripture, every one is bound to ſtudy them: things of common practice are plain and obvious in them, things at firſt to be believ'd are taken for granted, but Man is for his life-time employ'd, and to be ſo in farther ſearch into the meaning of thoſe things that are more obſcure. Could Man once in his life-time attain to a perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding <pb n="61" facs="tcp:102432:40"/> of every thing ſet down there, there would quickly be an end of all ſacred ſtudy; but ſince the wiſeſt find in the Word of God more than they can underſtand; and yet find they every day by ſtudy underſtand more and more; and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wits upon a due care and induſtry find proportionable advances, there is always enough to excite mans utmoſt diligence and care; and as in practical piety, ſo it is here, he that improves his time beſt to get knowledge, tho' he cannot reach to all he ſhould, his defects ſhall be pardoned for his ſake, who in himſelf contains conſummate wiſdom. But it remains ſtill true, that it could not reaſonably be requir'd that a man ſhould engage himſelf in the ſtudy of the whole Book of God if there were any thing poſitively aſſerted there, the knowledge and underſtanding of which would be loſt time, as the ſtudies of all impertinencies are. But howſoever neceſſary theſe ſtudies are, if they are not proſecuted in a due manner, <hi>i. e.</hi> with an humble ſenſe of our own natural defects, with a ſober and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive judgment, and with all that modeſty which becomes one who is deſirous to learn; they'l prove but miſchievous, and make Hereticks, Schiſmaticks or Atheiſts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of knowing and improving orthodox Chriſtians. It's true, that nothing ought to be admitted into Religion which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon, but it muſt be underſtood, <pb n="62" facs="tcp:102432:41"/> which is contrary to reaſon in its primitive integrity, for that which we call reaſon now we every one find extremely ſubject to miſtakes: and for me to meaſure thoſe truths which are reveal'd by an infallible God, by the ſtandard of that ſenſe or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I know to be miſtakeful and fallible, is unreaſonable, with any ſober diſcourſer, to extremity: and it argues too great a pride in our low condition to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that becauſe once we were made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that therefore we ſhould in any reſpect continue ſo, though we had ſought out to our ſelves many inventions. <hi>Many are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by their own vain opinion,</hi>

            <p>Having gone thus far in the debate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſe of Humane Reaſon in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and declared how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful we ſhould be not to indulge our ſelves in vain and uſeleſs curioſities; for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of our ſelves as Chriſtians we are to conſider, that a full proof of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Son of God is a task that comes under no reproof in the caſe. That the bleſſed Jeſus the great captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is God as well as Man, <hi>that he is God of God, light of light, very God of very God,</hi> as the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed expreſſes it; that he is perfect God, not a factitious or an aequivocal God, as ſome would have him; but that He who is God the Son is infinite in all his Attributes, God over all bleſſed for ever, as God the Father is, is <hi>Articulus ſtantis aut cadentis Eccleſiae,</hi> ſuch an Article of our Chriſtian Faith, ſo eſſential to the <pb n="64" facs="tcp:102432:42"/> Myſtical Body of Chriſt, that while it's embrac'd, the Church has a real Being; when it's laid aſide, the very Being of the Church expires at the ſame time. It's ſo neceſſary an Article of Faith, that except a man keep it <hi>whole and undefiled, without doubt he ſhall periſh everlaſtingly:</hi> for he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in ſuch a Meſſias, ſuch a Saviour who is not God, is really an Idolater, as fixing his belief in one that is not able to ſave. For Man's miſery is too great to be reliev'd by any inferiour power; and the blood of Bulls and of Goats might as well have ſerv'd for the expiation of Humane guilt, as the ſufferings of one who was a meer man, and conſequently could have no proper merit to plead for us, no inherent power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to aſſiſt us. Some of thoſe Hereticks who deny the Divinity of the Son of God, have been ſo ſenſible of this, that they have maintain'd and preach'd it in thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations where they have been concern'd, That it's as lawful to pray to the bleſſed Virgin, or to any other Saint, or any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, as it is to pray to the Son of God: and that all thoſe are really guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, who make any ſuch Prayers or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to him. Now tho other
<hi>Socinians</hi> call theſe blaſphemers on this account: they are really injurious to 'em; for if that which they all agree in be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt is not the moſt high God, then who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever worſhips him as God, breaks the <pb n="65" facs="tcp:102432:42"/> firſt and ſecond Commandments as much as thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do, and are as notorious Idolaters, as we ſhall hereafter have occaſion to prove. In queſt then of the truth of this doctrine, That Jeſus Chriſt is the true God, we are to bend our Reaſon, and to meet and baffle thoſe great pretenders to it with their own weapons, and to prove to them that tho we think the <hi>myſtery of godlineſs to be great,</hi> as the Text aſſerts it, to be

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the poſitive truth, that he who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the fleſh viſible to humane eyes, and ſo far humbled to atone for humane Crimes, was really God: hence to be ador'd by us, hence able to perform the work he came about, and to ſave to the utmoſt all thoſe that come to the Father in and by him; and this we firmly and ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, tho' we cannot comprehend the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or the manner how ſo great a miracle of Mercy ſhould be brought about: and thoſe proofs by any particulars whatſoever laid down, of this truth, uſing reaſon with that ſobriety and modeſty which we ought, we may examine and try throughly, and judge how far they come up to thoſe things they are deſigned to make good; and ſo our Faith it <pb n="66" facs="tcp:102432:43"/> ſelf may be rational and thence invincible, tho' every particular of it be not intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to us in its full extent. With rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Text then we aſſert</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Myſtery of Godlineſs which the Apoſtle tells us is great, cannot be apply'd to the ſeveral particulars laid down in the latter part of the verſe:</hi> for let us with <hi>Grotius,</hi> by the
<hi>myſtery of godlineſs</hi> underſtand the Goſpel, as we commonly underſtand it, and which we own does contain the <hi>myſtery of godlineſs.</hi> That the Goſpel was preach'd by weak Men we own, nay, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf in his ſtate of exinanition, or in his humane nature appear'd weak and contemptible enough we own too: but that the Goſpel appear'd in the fleſh, or cloath'd with fleſh, which is the proper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Apoſtles phraſe, we deny as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. That the Goſpel was juſtified in or by the Spirit, the miraculous effuſions of that, confirming the truth of the Goſpel preach'd, we may own well enough; but that the Goſpel was ſeen of Angels is ſcarce ſence, that it was never known before it had been declar'd by Men is falſe, for the Angels could not be unacquainted with the ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the old Teſtament concerning the Meſſias to come; nor could they be ſo far to ſeek in the meaning of thoſe Prophecies, many of which they had been inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in delivering: and the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <pb n="67" facs="tcp:102432:43"/> were indeed the firſt preachers of the Goſpel; So the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> tells

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:102432:44"/> Theſe inſtances are enough to prove that Angels knew the Goſpel before men preacht it: not to mention their adminiſtring to our Saviour in the wilderneſs, when entring on his prophetical Office, and their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing his reſurrection, the great confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel before his Apoſtles had any apprehenſions of it.

               <hi>Neither yet are they applicable to God the Father,</hi> as ſeveral of the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have them, for to ſay God the Father was manifeſt in the fleſh, becauſe his will was preach'd by Men, who were but fleſh and blood, beſides that ſuch an aſſertion quits the <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> or Subject which was God the Father, unleſs God and Gods will be one and the ſame thing, which cannot be aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, It's ſo uncouth an expreſſion, as is no where to be parallel'd either in Scripture, or any Eccleſiaſtical Writer.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102432:44"/> ever any dream of ſuch a thing, unleſs we recur to the ancient <hi>Patropaſſians,</hi> ſo call'd, becauſe they believ'd it was really God the Father, who being Incarnate ſuffer'd death on the Croſs, for the ſins of Mankind, but of that we have no foot-ſteps in holy Writ: nor was the Deity it ſelf ever made manifeſt in the fleſh, but in the fleſh of the bleſſed Jeſus,<note place="margin">

If we go farther, the matter is not mended at all, when we ſay God the Father was ſeen of Angels, for what novelty was there in that? had not they ſtood continually before his face from the inſtant of their firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? or ſhould we flie to God's will, was not that known to his peculiar Miniſters, till ſuch time as they came to learn it by the preaching of mortal men? who can imagine ſo ſhort a Text of Scripture, and deſign'd to make known the greateſt myſtery in the world, ſhould laſh out into ſuch abſolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies? but to proceed, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was preach'd to the Gentiles, but where? he's mention'd often doubtleſs as the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in thoſe Epiſtles written by the Apoſtles, to their Gentile Converts, but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> it ſelf is ſtil'd the <hi>Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles pretend to preach, nay to know nothing among their Converts, but

               <hi>and him crucified,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf, if we muſt ſay God the Father was preach'd, he was certainly preach'd moſt to the Antediluvian World by <hi>Noah</hi> and the elder Patriarchs, or he was preach'd to the <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom we acknowledge that they had no ſuch diſtinct notions of the Trinity, as we by the Goſpels aſſiſtance have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; <pb n="71" facs="tcp:102432:45"/> but yet both among <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles he was declar'd by other names, than that of <hi>God the Father:</hi> and if, according to our common Logical notions, Relatives do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſuppoſe or remove one another, if Jeſus Chriſt was not really and actually the Son of <hi>God,</hi> pre-exiſtent to his incarnation, the name of Father could not properly have been apply'd to the ſupreme <hi>God,</hi> nor he be preach'd to the World under that chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; ſo that in fine, we conclude that the preaching of <hi>God</hi> the Father to the World, was no part of the Myſtery of Godlineſs: Nor is it properly ſo to ſay, that
<hi>God</hi> the Father was believ'd on in the World, for that too was nothing newly effected by the appearance of our Saviour, the World in general from its firſt original believ'd there was a <hi>God,</hi> if there were any who from thoſe apprehenſions they had of the exiſtence of a <hi>God,</hi> ſet themſelves to live virtuouſly, as conſidering that <hi>God</hi> under the notion of a knowing and ſevere Judge, and one capable of rewarding men according to their works, ſuch Perſons believ'd in <hi>God</hi> according to our own ſenſe, when we repeat the Creed: Now that ſome did thus believe before our Saviour's appearance in the fleſh is unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable; all thoſe who liv'd religiouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promulgation of the
<hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, did thus believe in <hi>God,</hi> and are ſome of them remembred as the great Heroes of Faith, in the beginning of the Eleventh
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102432:46"/> Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> If then this were a Myſtery, it was of a very ancient ſtanding, and diſcovered long before the coming of Chriſt. The application of the particulars thus far failing, we have ſome reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that neither will the laſt agree any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to that impoſed ſenſe; He was received up in glory, or into glory: Here our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries flie to <hi>God</hi>'s will again, ſo confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God</hi> and <hi>God</hi>'s will, as if they were not to be conſidered as diſtinct, but this we have conſider'd before, where we obſerved that contradiction the Goſpel met with in the World: As to
<hi>God</hi> the Father, where or when, or how, or by whom was he receiv'd up in glory, the holy Scriptures give us no intimation of his having deſcended at any time from Heaven to Earth, and He that's receiv'd up into glory ought to be ſo receiv'd by ſome Being ſuperior to himſelf, which a

For he who was ſo preach'd to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was indeed believed on in the world; The three Eaſtern Sages, who adored our Saviour in his infant age, were the firſt fruits of the <hi>Gentile</hi> world, and even
<hi>Samaritans</hi> were profelyted to his Doctrine while he converſt with the world; to believe in him was that condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Salvation could not be attained. So he teaches <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>

It was a juſt ſenſe of the indiſpenſible nature of this condition, that made men ſubmit ſo readily to the firſt preaching of the Apoſtles, and fly out ſo eagerly and ſo early into that Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi>
'Twas that which in <hi>Judaea</hi> brought multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes daily into the Church, of ſuch as ſhould be ſaved: and enabled S. <hi>Paul</hi> to preach the Goſpel fully from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and round about unto

And to this day the ſame bleſſed Jeſus is the only rational hope of all that dwell on the earth, and of thoſe that remain on the broad Sea.

Having thus given the true interpretation of the Text, take its full meaning together in this Paraphraſe, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtill ſpeaking to and inſtructing <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> as in this Verſe he does.</p>
            <p>It's not without great Reaſon that I have given thee, who art thy ſelf a Biſhop in it, ſuch directions about thoſe whom thou art to admit as Miniſters in the Church of God. That Religion our bleſſed Maſter has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to us, has nothing in it but what is Holy and Pure, too pure to be touch'd with unclean hands, and not fit for every unlearned and preſuming Novice to meddle with. The whole Body of our Faith is founded upon ſuch things as are infinitely true, but of ſo ſublime and ſurpriſing a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the ſtrongeſt Humane Reaſon can never wholly comprehend them all: let me but name them as reveal'd, and all mankind will ſoon agree, that the moſt ſoaring and capacious Soul muſt falter in its enquiries after them. The eternal Son of God, God equal with his Father, the great Creator of all things; rather than periſhing man ſhould be eternally loſt, reſolv'd to atone divine vengeance with his own ſufferings, and ſince without blood there could be no remiſſion, and the immenſe Divinity could not ſuffer <pb n="80" facs="tcp:102432:50"/> ſo, He took fleſh and blood, our weak and paſſible nature upon himſelf, and in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture offered himſelf a ſacrifice to his Father for us. This glorious Sacrifice produc'd the great effect, and reconciled our angry Judge; but that undertaking was too great for man, tho' ſo deeply concern'd, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; the chaſm between an holy God and polluted man too wide and hideous deep ever to be made up. It's true, when God himſelf was mention'd as the undertaker of ſo great a work, even deſpairing man might entertain ſome dawning hopes; but when they ſaw a poor Carpenter's Son, one who had not ſo much as where to lay his head, aſſume yet the glorious title of the world's Redeemer and Saviour, their hopes ſlagg'd, their almoſt graſped joys ſeem'd juſt vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into empty air: When the Holy Ghoſt, God too, infinitely good, and powerful, and wiſe, interpos'd, and attended that humble Man with ſo much vigour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, that He, by a thouſand glorious actions, and by a cloſe and perpetual cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Heaven, viſible even to vulgar eyes, prov'd the entire Union that was between himſelf and his Father, and that Sacred Spirit: and juſtified himſelf in the thoughts of very aliens themſelves, who could not but acknowledge, of a truth, that, for all his mean appearance and his ſcandalous Paſſion on the Croſs, He was the Son of God. But could men have <pb n="81" facs="tcp:102432:50"/> doubted ſtill, the happy Angels thoſe purer and more diſcerning Spirits ſaw him too, they ſaw him and knew him, and ador'd him, they ſaw their mighty Lord, tho' veil'd in all the rags of poor mortality: And tho' ſin might have made a former breach between thoſe bleſſed Spirits and polluted man; yet now where their Lord loved they lov'd too, and always look'd, and always waited on him while he wrought the worlds redemption: while he was ſo juſtified and ſo attended on, divers gave up themſelves abſolutely to his ſervice, whom he lov'd, and taught, and protected, and endued with miraculous knowledge, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and courage, and ſent them on that bleſſed errand to preach to the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> the glad tydings of Salvation in his name: They boldly undertook the work, and tho' they had ignorance and prejudice, and malice and cunning to contend with: meer men contemn'd before, but then inſpired, broke through all oppoſition, and the forſaken <hi>Gentiles</hi> heard the gladſome ſounds of peace; and tho' there were too many enemies to their own good, yet thoſe laborious meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of Heaven preached with that power and efficacy, that men began every where to call on the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Nay, the more men of perverſe minds croſs'd the deſigns of that Goſpel preach'd in the name of the Son of God, the more thoſe who believed in him were <pb n="82" facs="tcp:102432:51"/> multiplied. As for himſelf, when he had finiſhed that ſtupendous work, and by his own Death had conquered Hell and Death; He broke thoſe fatal chains, and roſe again, no more lyable to humane rage. His Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Father who had viewed all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious efforts of his Love to mankind with an ineffable complacency, reach'd out his holy arm to receive that very humane Nature in which his beloved Son had done and ſuffered ſo much: from him the chearful clouds were ſent for a Chariot, and he went upwards flying upon the wings of the wind, while j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But here learning, and ſtudy, a ſtrict fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with God's Word, and an exerciſed experience carry the Chriſtian Prieſt thro' a great many vexatious enquiries, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt conſultation with others, who are bleſt with ſuch qualifications, tends much to the ſettlement of dubious minds; but after all, theſe are properly no myſteries, for the rules of Scripture, by which ſuch inquiries are ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately determined, are very plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every underſtanding, their nature being like that of a Light in a dark place, which ſerves to guide and direct Travellers in the way they ſhould go; but the occaſion of theſe doubts is the miſapplication of rules to matter of fact, the miſapprehenſion or miſrepreſentation of circumſtances,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the diſtempers of the Soul are much like the diſeaſes of the body, if the Patient can give a juſt and rational account of thoſe parts about him which are griev'd, and how he finds himſelf, the Phyſician eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands <pb n="86" facs="tcp:102432:53"/> the diſeaſe, and is able to apply the proper medicines: but if the Patient gives a broken and uncertain account of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, even a skilful Phyſician may groſly miſtake the diſeaſe and its remedy to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's ruine; ſo when doubting Chriſtians underſtand not the ſtate of their own Souls, nor the firſt motives or occaſions of their fears, or where they are afraid or aſhamed to lay open themſelves with all ſincerity to him, from whom they expect relief, it's not to be wondred at, if excellent advices fail of their proper effect, whereas a true inſight into a Man's ſelf makes the greateſt ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficulties eaſily and certainly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>As for matters of Faith they are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, and (tho' matters of practice, ſo far as practice is religious, depend upon what the Chriſtian believes altogether and are ſo very plain as I ſhew'd before) yet thoſe objects of faith, are ſo far beyond the reach of reaſon, as it is from Earth to Heaven; nay, that very faith without which, as we are ſufficiently aſſur'd, it's impoſſible to pleaſe God, though it be inherent in the pious Soul, is abſolutely myſterious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable. We feel the prodigious force of it in thoſe acts whereby it raiſes the Soul to a contemplation of Divine things, but it is as the Prophets of old felt the inſpiring energy of the ſacred Spirit, when they ſpoke what it dictated, but could give no account <pb n="87" facs="tcp:102432:53"/> of the methods of its operation in them; the Apoſtle when he tells us of it, that it's <gap reason="foreign">

It imports indeed that true faith is of ſo efficacious a nature, that tho' it have reſpect onely to things which are at a diſtance, yet it repreſents them to the Soul ſo plainly and ſo powerfully, that the Soul reaps equal ſatisfaction from that diſtant view as it would from an immediate poſſeſſion. <hi>Meginhardus</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Monk writes well of it, when he ſays, Faith is called the ſubſtance of things hoped for by a figure, not that it's really their proper ſubſtance, but becauſe that faith which works by love, by which the juſt live, and by which power is given to us that we ſhould be call'd and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the Sons of God, that faith in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome pilgrimage of this life meditates on the reward of eternal happineſs with ſo firm and certain an hope, <hi>

Again, it's the evidence of things not ſeen, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out-going humane reaſon in this life, for if humane reaſon were clear enough to prove to us thoſe things undeniably which we expect in a future ſtate, there would then be no need of any other evidence, at leaſt we ſhould not by the Apoſtle be referr'd to an evidence naturally more obſcure, when reaſon, that by which we do or ſhould moſt commonly act, could give us what was much more plain and obvious; but our reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notoriouſly defective in the caſe, our firm belief that there is an Heaven of joys, and an Hell of woes to be met with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, is an argument not to be anſwer'd, that there are really ſuch things; for the Soul of Man is not eaſily carried out of it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to violent longings after a meer phantaſtical <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102432:54"/> good, nor is it ordinarily terrified with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Mormoes or bug-bears, but where it runs out moſt into fabulous or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative expreſſions of its expectations, there's ſomewhat real and ſound in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; ſo thoſe that talk of infernal Judges in Hell, and various kinds of ſenſible pains to be there felt, and of Furies torturing Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all agree certainly in that, that vengeance does certainly attend ill actions, and that tho' Men may eſcape plauſibly in this world, they ſhall certainly ſuffer terribly in the next, tho' they cannot make a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conjecture how a guilty Spirit ſhould ſuffer to ſuch extremity: In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, thoſe that tell us of Elyſian fields a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with variety of beautiful Flowers, bleſt with a ſerene Air and a continual Spring, where thoſe that have done well, happy in each others ſociety, ſhall live in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturb'd pleaſures beyond the reach of fates malice, or times conſumption, All ſuch prove their certain belief, that there is and ſhall be a reward for the righteous, that is an unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd felicity to be attain'd; but what a kind of felicity that is which is infinite and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who can tell? nay who would value them as the Saints do, if they could poſſibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them? No, it is becauſe <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor has it entred into the heart of man to conceive how great thoſe things are, which God has prepared for thoſe that love him,</hi> Therefore the holy and the wiſe are <pb n="90" facs="tcp:102432:55"/> always panting after thoſe enjoyments, as <hi>the thirſty Hart pants after the water brooks,</hi> therefore they are willing to undergo every thing that a malignant World can lay upon them, as being certainly aſſured, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the joys of Heaven are, all the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or ſufferings they can meet with in this World are not worthy to be compared with them; Impreſſions looking toward theſe things are ſo natural to the Soul of Man, that all the artifices of wickedneſs are not able to efface them, and yet the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe impreſſions are ſo great and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious, that all the wit of Man cannot poſſibly comprehend them, yet faith goes through with all, and is not, cannot be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in its confidence at laſt.</p>
            <p>If Faith it ſelf, the continual ſecurity of the Soul, be ſo dark and undefinable, what muſt we judge of the objects of it, they being generally ſo vaſt, that Faith it ſelf, ſoaring as it is, can go but a very little way in its Idea's of them: that the objects of Faith are real and true, is evident from what has been ſaid, that their Nature is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, and their Reaſons inſcrutable to created Beings, is as true, but not at all to be wonder'd at; ſince there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand common effects of Nature, the truth of which we are beyond contradiction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of: but why they ſhould happen ſo or ſo, the cunningeſt Philoſophers are no more able to reſolve than deſpiſed Ideots <pb n="91" facs="tcp:102432:55"/> or Naturals. Agreeably to what I am urging I inſtanc'd before in the being of God, a truth which Men cannot balk tho' they take never ſo much pains to that purpoſe; that this God, this ſupreme Governour or Manager of all things muſt ſome way or other communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf to his Creatures, for that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they could neither pretend to a well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a being, is as clear by rational diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: but how God ſhould communicate of himſelf to theſe creatures, where there is ſo vaſt a diſproportion in their Natures, is a riddle which we have not yet found any <hi>Apollo</hi> ſubtle enough to reſolve; and yet that God does communicate himſelf to his creatures is as plain, and undeniable. Thoſe who engage themſelves into enquiries about theſe things do but loſe themſelves in inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable Labyrinths, and indeed, according to the genuine rules of right reaſon, do but take pains to no purpoſe; it was that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſenſe which mankind all along has had of theſe things, that has made them endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to frame ſome ſhort Idea's of the Deity to themſelves, and ſo, tho' they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing adaequate to his Nature, yet they have run high as words can carry them, when they ſtile God a being infinitely juſt, powerful, good, merciful, wiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe general notions of theirs in ſome meaſure influenc'd the lives of many, but much more all the external and viſible parts of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Devotions: And when they have
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102432:56"/> ſhewed their utmoſt skill in contriving Schemes of divine Worſhip, thoſe men have done beſt and moſt ſutably to the nature of Religion, who have contrived the outward parts of it ſo, as they might a little ſhadow out the neceſſary apprehenſions of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and yet ſo too that the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, who made the niceſt obſervations of things, might be ſenſible, that thoſe exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal religious ſhews referred to a great deal of a darker and more inintelligible nature, and which no Symbols whatſoever could poſſibly illuſtrate or repreſent; and thoſe Divine Oracles which were ſpoken of in all parts of the World, as they rendred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion more Auguſt and Venerable to the eye of the World, ſo the nature of thoſe Oracles convinced the World yet more ſtrongly of the defectiveneſs of humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the certain knowledge of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity where men imagine themſelves free agents, being Eſſential to the Deity, but one of the moſt puzling things humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can poſſibly fix upon: This the <hi>Romans</hi> and their predeceſſors the <hi>Latines</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by a <hi>Janus</hi> with two faces, the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trurians</hi> by a <hi>Janus</hi> with four, which might, as ſome tell us, refer to the four parts of the year, but more genuinely it repreſented the Deity looking every way, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paſt, preſent or to come could poſſibly avoid its knowledge; and the Prophets of old had that character as communicated to <pb n="93" facs="tcp:102432:56"/> them from the inſpiring Deity, that they knew, <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Jews:</hi> if yet they would have a ſhew of any Religion, they were under a neceſſity of ſuiting it with ſome circumſtantial rites, which when they had try'd their utmoſt skill had a <hi>meaning,</hi> but that

<hi>Hieroglyphical Theology</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> was in a great meaſure rais'd from thoſe hints they had taken of Man's duty to the World's Creator, from their converſe with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Patriarchs, that the firſt contrivers of it were capable of making it conſiderably uſeful and inſtructive to the World, and from thence thoſe ſeeds of Moral Virtues, which bore ſome fruit in ancient Heathens, had their originals;

            <p>As it was the unhappineſs of the Gentiles to be encombred with a great deal of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſo it muſt follow, that <hi>their Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> where cleareſt, had but a very indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect aſpect to their acknowledgments and expectations. But the Jewiſh ſolemnities and predictions had a more exact and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect aim at the coming of the promis'd Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, their <hi>Prophets</hi> were more numerous, their

Yet their Religion was

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102432:66"/> or reflex of his glory</hi> was as far off compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending his full glory as before; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles when in their transfigured Maſter they ſaw a glorified body, yet were unable to expreſs what they ſaw but by very weak re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> when ecſtaſied in the third heavens, could no more compleatly comprehend the felicities or glorious viſions of that place than he could before: Since then natural reaſon led the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve myſtick truths, and God led his own people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the like, from both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may conclude, That Religion it ſelf cannot ſubſiſt without them, and that thoſe things which are called <hi>myſteries in Religion</hi> are not therefore to be rejected, becauſe they are <hi>myſteries indeed, i. e.</hi> becauſe every little pretender to ſence cannot comprehend them. And ſo we come to the ſecond enquiry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the beginning of this diſcourſe, and that is,</p>

<hi>Obedience</hi> was the great firſt end of every Law, and a Law was given our firſt Parent to put him upon a tryal of <hi>original prudence,</hi> which could never put him upon any thing but what was excellent; when pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeem'd drowſie, ſin crept upon him, and ruin'd him and his proſperity, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Man ſinned, God did not therefore change the nature of his commands, but he <pb n="149" facs="tcp:102432:84"/> explain'd and improv'd them, by adding particulars coincident with them; he ſupply'd the defects of reaſon impair'd, and reveal'd thoſe things at which it might have ſtumbled beyond recovery: <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons had not a new Law, but the ſame again illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted farther, and more clear'd up by <hi>additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal revelation,</hi> to ſupply the greater decays of humane abilities: Nor did God change his mind when he choſe the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> from the reſt of Mankind, or give <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> any <hi>new Laws</hi> eſſential to Religion, for

<hi>beſt and pureſt Religion</hi> which has the greateſt effects in that deſign, if thoſe who were his <hi>Diſciples</hi> would but take care to evidence their <hi>Diſcipleſhip</hi> by that <hi>mutual love and endearing charity,</hi> they would, at the ſame time, convince the world that the Lord whom they follow'd was truly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd by Heaven, that the Doctrine which He preach'd was really agreeable to the Will of God, and that <hi>Love</hi> being the firſt intention of pure and uncorrupted Nature, That which raiſed and encouraged men moſt powerfully to it muſt needs be the moſt ſuitable to that original purity of Nature.

            <p>The force and convincing power of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> lay indeed wholly in the inexplicabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their reaſon: So long as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> could work wonders, in appearance, parallel with thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they believ'd him no <hi>Meſſenger ſent from God,</hi> but a <hi>cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Jugler</hi> like themſelves, and how they wrought ſuch ſurprizing wonders, they knew well enough; but when

               <hi>whom God rais'd from the dead, even by him doth this man ſtand before you whole;</hi> by which account they left them but in a maze of myſtery and wonder more inextricable than before; But if the unwonted cures of diſtempers, the ejection <pb n="188" facs="tcp:102432:104"/> of Devils, the reſtauration of dead bodies to life, could over-aw the moſt obſtinate ſtubbornneſs, how much more muſt the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious ſubjects of our faith,</hi> the appearance of the Son of God in our nature, his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death for our redemption, his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aſcenſion up into glory, truths of a more ſublime and incomprehenſible nature, and confirm'd too by thoſe very aſtoniſhing miracles, work men to a profound venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Religion grounded upon them! I'le add, that had it been poſſible for God ſo far to have laid aſide his own immenſe glory, that men might have ſeen it fully and with open face, that they might have plainly read how all thoſe wonders of love and mercy had been wrought, it would have been altogether unfit, ſince the pride of man would have been apt to trample upon, and deſpiſe the known cauſe of the moſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected productions.</p>
            <p>It's neceſſary then that the <hi>fundamentals of Chriſt's Religion</hi> ſhould carry with them ſomewhat of that <hi>awful Majeſty</hi> inherent in its founder, nor is <hi>this wiſdom of God in a Myſtery</hi> to be laid open to ſcoffing Atheiſts, or Men onely impertinently curious after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties; <hi>Pearles are not to be caſt before Swine, nor Holy things to Dogs:</hi> The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the primitive Church were very ſtrict in this reſpect, inſomuch that the Gentiles objected it againſt them, that they kept the very God they worſhip'd unknown

<hi>Ethnics,</hi> who would then, as the conceited <hi>Socinians</hi> do now, deride every thing they could not underſtand: So <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius,</hi> ſpeaking of the Reſurrection, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which Chriſtians ever own'd as a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, and which Heathens thought the moſt abſurd and irrational principle in the World, ſubjoyns at laſt, <hi>This is that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Prophets which we Christians maintain, this is our wiſdom which Idolatrous pretenders to Philoſophy contemn as vain and ſilly, becauſe we make it no ſubject of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick diſputations, but God has commanded us,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102432:105"/> that we ſhould peaceably and ſilently lay up his ſecret in our hearts and conſciences, not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly wrangling with profane perſons, who violently oppoſe God and his religion, not with a deſign to ſift out the truth, but to expoſe it to a publick ſcorn; Nor ought the Myſtery to be diſcover'd by us eſpecially, who denominate our ſelves from that faith:</hi> Nay, even thoſe who were Converts to Chriſtianity were but gradually enter'd into theſe things; the
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumeni</hi> and <hi>Energumeni</hi> being ſhut out of the Church ſo ſoon as the Sermon was done, and not permitted to be ſo much as Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the <hi>Sacramental Myſteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been hitherto diſcours'd, we may juſtly conclude, That ſince Religion can have no part or intereſt, ordinarily, in the hearts of Men, unleſs it be uſher'd in by cauſes Myſterious, ſupernatural, or in their full extent incomprehenſible: Since our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour by introducing his Goſpel into the World, has not taken away, but ſtrongly confirm'd the neceſſity of obedience to God's Laws, whether written or natural, which was, as we have before obſerv'd, the general intent of Religion, and agreeable to thoſe notions the World commonly had of it: Since, for the better carrying on this end, <hi>Myſteries</hi> are ſo very advantageous to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as to make Men have reverend appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of it, upon account of its incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Excellencies in its cauſes and effects, <pb n="191" facs="tcp:102432:105"/> and upon account of the weakneſs and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of their own underſtandings, ſince all theſe particulars are true; it's likewiſe abſolutely neceſſary, <hi>that the Chriſtian, the onely true, Holy, pure Religion, ſhould be built upon ſuch a foundation, as might appear to all Men, upon the ſtricteſt inquiry, beyond all doubt or controverſie, Myſterious, inexplicable, incomprehenſible.</hi> Nor could it be an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent labour to clear this truth, becauſe it totally ruines all the pretences of the
<hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that, <hi>after the Revelation once made of the great fundamentals of our Faith, there could remain nothing of ſo obſcure a nature, but that we by the pure ſtrength of our own reaſon might be able to comprehend it,</hi> In ſhort, that though it be true, that Scripture, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for that purpoſe, is and ought to <hi>be the ſole rule of Faith,</hi> yet <hi>reaſon ought to be the rule of Scripture,</hi> Reaſon, as it now ſtands, loaded with all the miſerable conſequences of ſin, reaſon ſo blind, as without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary light of holy Scriptures, to be wholly unable to lead a Man to Eternal life; it obviates their aſſertions, that the true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Catholick Interpretation of this and other Texts of Scripture, that ſpeak of the <hi>eternal Divine nature of the Son of God,</hi> or of that <hi>glorious Trinity</hi> ſubſiſting in the
<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, meerly becauſe it introduces an <hi>unintelligible incarnation</hi> and unity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane nature in Chriſt: <hi>a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102432:106"/> co-eſſentiality of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all thoſe glorious revelations God has made of himſelf in Scripture; For if it be certainly true, that <hi>Religion</hi> in it's general notion, cannot ſubſiſt unleſs built upon a <hi>myſtick foundation,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtian Religion in particular can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without it, then it will follow, that the continuing Myſtick nature of the great Articles of our Faith, can create no prejudice in any perſon whatſoever againſt our Religion on their account; ſince eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it will remain impoſſible to draw any genuine conſequences from thoſe <hi>myſteries,</hi> but what will be ſo far from impeaching, that they will ſtrongly confirm and re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force all thoſe duties relating to God or man, which are laid upon us by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or written Law; and it will follow far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the
<hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves, by their endeavours to level all the Articles of our Faith, the great ſaving principles of the Goſpel, to impair'd reaſon, or by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to leave Chriſtiany naked of all My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, do what in them lies, to diſannul all the Religion of Chriſtians, to take away all the uſe and advantage of the Goſpel, leaving the world ſo involv'd in <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> or in <hi>meer Deiſm,</hi> at this time very little to be preferr'd before the other.</p>

<hi>He who was made fleſh for the Salvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was really God, God properly ſo call'd, the moſt high, the eternal God, bleſſed for ever,</hi> not any <hi>made or ſubordinate God,</hi> but the maker of all things, in a word, the true God, excluſive of all created Beings whatſoever. We aſſert that this is an Article of our Faith, ſo true and ſo important, that upon a true embracing it in the ſence ſo laid down, the Salvation of all men depends; as much, as upon believing in Chriſt the Son of God at all, or on being neither <hi>impious,</hi> nor
<hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> nor <hi>idolaters:</hi> And therefore we aſſert farther, that how great a <hi>myſtery</hi> ſoever <pb n="197" facs="tcp:102432:108"/> this may appear, (and it never ought to appear otherwiſe) to enquire into and ſeek for all ſuch Scriptures, as may render it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable, is neither
<hi>impertinent to our Lord's deſign,</hi> in being ſo incarnate, nor
<hi>is it fruitleſs</hi> to thoſe who make it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to inquire into ſuch proofs, nor <hi>is it dangerous to any,</hi> who make that enquiry with due humility and care: But on the contrary it's very dangerous, nay fatal, as before, not to enquire into it, or not to be fully ſatisfied about it.</p>
            <p>I know we have in this point more enemies than the <hi>meer Socinians,</hi> ſome capital aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Arminian</hi> tenets, being deſirous to give ſuch a <hi>latitude</hi> to Religion, as may take in all their <hi>friends,</hi> are very willing to perſwade us, that it's not very material, or neceſſary to believe, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, is God of the ſame ſubſtance or nature with his father.</hi> So
<hi>Epiſcopius</hi> a man of great learning and ingenuity in his fourth book of <hi>Theological Inſtitutions, c.</hi> 34.<note place="margin">Traitè ſur la Divin. de J.C.S. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>10.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſum of whoſe plea amounts to this, That <hi>the eſſence of Chriſtian Religion conſiſts not in meer contemplative knowledge, but in practice, and that it conſiſts much more in obedience, than in abſtracted ſpeculations on the Deity,</hi> which, tho' it be true enough, has really no place here, for can we call thoſe <hi>principles</hi> meer or <hi>ſimple ſpeculations,</hi> which are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, that we our ſelves are or are not <hi>Idolaters,</hi> accordingly as they are true or
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102432:109"/> falſe? If Chriſt be of the ſame ſubſtance with his Father, or if, which comes to the ſame end, <hi>Chriſt be the ſupreme or ſovereign God,</hi> he ought to be adored in that quality; and
<hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves cannot without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety refuſe to acknowledge him as ſuch, and to honour him under that name: but if he be not ſo, we cannot confound him with the Sovereign God, without Idolatry: The great concern here then is, to avoid impiety, or idolatry; and by conſequence, thoſe
<hi>inquiries</hi> muſt be of a <hi>practical nature,</hi> which are of ſo very great and extraordinary an importance. <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> makes ſeveral vain attempts to ſhew, <hi>That it is not at all eſſential to Salvation to know if Jeſus Chriſt be God by an eternal generation;</hi> or that, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a ſimple creature, or which is the ſame, a meer man like one of us, he is called God upon account of his miniſtry:</hi> for when he goes about to make us ſee that theſe are no fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental inquiries, in ſhewing us that thoſe, who believe Jeſus Chriſt is a meer Creature, may worſhip him without being guilty of Idolatry, becauſe they adore him not
<hi>as he is man,</hi> but <hi>as he holds the place of God,</hi> as his
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> or <hi>Subſtitute:</hi> this proof is imperfect and inſufficient. For to prove that theſe queſtions are impertinent or unneceſſary, it's not enough to ſhew that <hi>Socinians,</hi> without being <hi>Idolaters,</hi> may worſhip him, whom they believe to be no more by nature than a meer Man, which <pb n="199" facs="tcp:102432:109"/> ſuppoſition yet we ſhall in due time prove, God willing, to be falſe. But he ought to ſhew withal, that we <hi>without Idolatry may worſhip Jeſus Chriſt as the ſupreme God</hi> (as we really are taught to do by the Church of
<hi>England</hi>) tho' at the ſame time he really be not the ſovereign God; which ſeems to be a very hard if not an impoſſible task, as I queſtion not but hereafter it will more plainly appear. At preſent I ſhall only touch upon an argument, urged by <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> from a Topick very eaſily found out; the reaſon then given by him, why it is not neceſſary that we ſhould believe Jeſus Chriſt to be perfect, or the true God, is,
<hi>Quia nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiam in Scripturâ id neceſſarium creditu eſſe aſſeritur, nec per bonam, nedum neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am conſequentiam ex eâ elicitur, Becauſe it's a doctrine of which the Scripture no where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that it's neceſſary to be believed, nor can it be drawn from thence by any good, much leſs by any neceſſary conſequence:</hi> And he goes on to ſhew, that this argument ought to be of very great force among thoſe of the <hi>reformation,</hi> becauſe they profeſs there's nothing neceſſary to be believed, but what's either directly, or in plain terms contained in Scripture, or drawn from thence by very clear conſequence; the laſt indeed, the ſixth <hi>Article of the Church of England</hi> agrees with, but what ſhe thinks of his firſt aſſertion, may very well be gathered from the ſecond, wherein ſhe propounds this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102432:110"/> as neceſſary to be believed, <hi>The Son, which is the word of the Father begotten from everlaſting of the Father, the very and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, of one ſubſtance with the Father, took man's nature in the womb of the bleſſed Virgin, of her ſubſtance, ſo that two whole and perfect natures, that is to ſay, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and manhood, were joyn'd together in one perſon, never to be divided, whereof is one Chriſt, very God and very man,</hi> &amp;c.

<hi>Son of God, begotten of his father before all worlds,</hi> in contradiſtinction to <hi>creation:</hi> But it would not have been enough to ſatisfie the world in the truth of that extraordinary original for them to aſſert it; for tho' men value great diſcoveries according to the credit of their <hi>Authors,</hi> yet the weight and greatneſs of the diſcoveries make them nice and curious in their diſquiſitions about them that they may not be impos'd on, for how wretched a diſappointment would it have been for a whole world, to be big with the violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a Saviour, to be throughly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their own neceſſity, to have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men boldly publiſh to them, that the expected Saviour was really come and qualified ſuitably to thoſe wonderful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations they had of him, and yet to find nothing but a <hi>ſham</hi> or an <hi>impoſture</hi> at laſt, a <hi>Bar-cozbi</hi> the Son of a ly, inſtead of a <hi>Barcochab, the Star that ſhould have riſen in Jacob,</hi> as the unhappy <hi>Jews</hi> were deluded at laſt.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a caſe Men are wont to look for <hi>clear and uncontroulable evidences</hi> of the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the

In the evidences of his being the Son of God, lay all the ſtrength and weight of his Doctrine, and the validity and efficacy of that Repentance preach'd by the Apoſtles in his name; had he, after all thoſe <hi>glorious pretences,</hi> been one of an <hi>inferior rank,</hi> there never had been ſo great an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> in the world as Chriſt, nor ſuch <hi>frontleſs cheats</hi> as his Apoſtles, nor ſuch <hi>abuſed, beſotted, bewitched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> in Nature as the Chriſtians in all ages have been: Therefore to vindicate both their own Credit and that of their Maſter, the Evangeliſts in their writings, firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the common knowledge of thoſe who liv'd at the ſame time that Chriſt convers'd on earth, at which time had what they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed been falſe, it would certainly have been quickly confuted by the <hi>intereſted Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> who ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves expos'd under the characters of the <hi>moſt obſtinate and ingrateful infidels in the world,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> who ſaw themſelves traduced as <hi>tools in the hands of their own vaſſals to carry on the moſt barbarous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable <pb n="214" facs="tcp:102432:117"/> cruelties;</hi> would certainly have vindicated themſelves to the utmoſt againſt their
<hi>ſlanderers,</hi> could they have found any <hi>flaws</hi> in thoſe things they delivered; yet the <hi>Jews</hi> never went about to deny the
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence</hi> of Jeſus the ſuppoſed Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> nor the <hi>reality</hi> of thoſe mighty works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by him, but rather to ſhew the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of all thoſe things tho' Jeſus were not the Meſſias, wherein they were eaſily baffled, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> endeavoured to confront his <hi>Miracles</hi> by the pretended wonders wrought by <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius Thyanaeus,</hi> and ſo to depretiate the Meſſiah's reputation, but with as little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: And indeed it was almoſt inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that a company of <hi>mean men,</hi> looked upon generally with an evil eye, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to publiſh a parcel of <hi>notorious falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,</hi> which every man upon his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge could have confuted, and thereby have expoſed themſelves to the juſt fury of a deluded multitude: it was inconceivable that ſo many in their <hi>writings</hi> and <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> could at ſuch <hi>different times</hi> and ſuch <hi>diſtant places</hi> agree together, to put a ſham upon mankind, and to do it ſo coherently in it ſelf, and ſo agreeably to one another, as it was apparent theſe men did. Now in writing a <hi>Hiſtory of immediate tranſactions,</hi> there can be nothing fairer in the world than for men who are eye and ear witneſſes of the things in queſtion to compile the <pb n="215" facs="tcp:102432:117"/> ſtory, and to publiſh it in their times who knew the ſame things whether they were true or falſe, as certainly as themſelves, and an Hiſtory ſo written, that paſſes through ſuch an age without reproof, may juſtly paſs for <hi>authentick,</hi> nor can any meer humane teſtimony attain a greater certainty. And where the ſubject of ſuch a Hiſtory is <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> where many things are declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of <hi>humane capacities,</hi> where they are yet laid down ſo exactly agreeable to thoſe things obvious to <hi>humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,</hi> and where there appears nothing diſagreeable to the

<hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;</hi> But our Saviour purſued another Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, He trod in thoſe ſteps ſo many had traced very happily before, He endeavour'd to advance onely ſuch notions as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly of <hi>Divine original,</hi> He propounded them to the Judgment and cenſure of all, He was ready to anſwer all <hi>Queſtions,</hi> to reſolve all <hi>doubts,</hi> to ſilence all <hi>cavils,</hi> and though He carried on his purpoſe with the utmoſt Zeal, yet He made uſe onely of <hi>gentle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,</hi> and <hi>of unanſwerable arguments,</hi> which none who were not <hi>direct enemies to reaſon,</hi> could refuſe: He pleaded a <hi>Divine authority</hi> for his undertaking, yet deſir'd not that his Plea ſhould be regarded any farther than he confirm'd it by his works, and by the Innocence of his life; his works were truly miraculous, all works of mercy not of terror, obliging not only his friends by them, but his very enemies, witneſs the cure of <hi>Malchus</hi>'s ear; He call'd for no <hi>fire down from Heaven, no Earthquakes, no ſtorms of Sulphur, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Deluges</hi> to force Men to ſubmiſſion, but endeavour'd fairly to convince all who had not heard of his Doctrine before, how much it tended to their welfare, not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their objections, or ſtudying little ſhifts and artifices to evade them. Now if thoſe who have made men better than they were by <hi>plain force</hi> are juſtly celebrated by all as <pb n="270" facs="tcp:102432:145"/>

<hi>projects</hi> found <hi>abſurd and unprofitable</hi> for acquiring that they aim'd at: When the Goſpel of our Saviour came to be divulged, tho' it met with <hi>adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> enough, they were all too weak to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val date its ſtrength and reaſon. It was neither the juggling fair-tongu'd
<hi>Phariſee,</hi> nor the abſurd and ambitious <hi>Saducee,</hi> nor the
<hi>wrangling Sophiſter,</hi> nor the <hi>Sceptical or cunning Philoſopher,</hi> nor the <hi>undermining <pb n="275" facs="tcp:102432:147"/> Heretick,</hi> that were able to ruine the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> but it ſtill grew upon them tho' they were cruelly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by <hi>earthly powers,</hi> and indeed made uſe of all the rougheſt means for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the Profeſſors of the Goſpel. And what was very conſiderable, tho' the great <hi>promoters of Religion</hi> after the Apoſtles and their immediate Succeſſor's times, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the <hi>gift of languages,</hi> nor had much of the <hi>learned education</hi> of thoſe Ages, yet they were able, having truth on their ſide to baffle all the <hi>learning</hi> of the <hi>great wiſe men</hi> among both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> which could never have happened, had not what they

<hi>promiſes</hi> were the moſt <hi>excellent and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,</hi> and whoſe <hi>rules</hi> the moſt <hi>general, intelligible and unqueſtionable. Pagans</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> if they were not <hi>wilfully ignorant,</hi> could not but ſee all thoſe <hi>principles of reaſon</hi> which themſelves pretended to, extremely advanc'd by this doctrine introduced by Chriſt; for whereas they were wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry <hi>pride and haughtineſs of ſpirit, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and contempt of others,</hi> very earneſtly, its true the vice was ſo notorious that they could not want arguments to diſgrace it: yet while <hi>ambition and an enterpriſing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> were commended, while their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded Philoſophers were the perſons who above all others
<hi>contemn'd and vilified the vulgar,</hi> and ſince their <hi>very gods</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them as <hi>tainted</hi> with the ſame fault, their <hi>ingenious Lectures and fine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes</hi> againſt it were generally loſt.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I come now to enquire into that influence,
<hi>Scripture-hiſtory</hi> in thoſe caſes ought to have upon all thoſe who own <hi>the Being of a God,</hi> whether they be converted to Chriſtianity or not, which will neceſſarily take in that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which the Word of God, as ſuch, ought to have with an <hi>Infidel;</hi> which enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though it be of a nice and ſpeculative nature, yet it will neceſſarily convince All <pb n="284" facs="tcp:102432:152"/> of that value they ought to ſet upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when they call themſelves <hi>Believers</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> how careful they ſhould be to <hi>puniſh</hi> and
<hi>diſcourage</hi> all <hi>ſlights</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts</hi> thrown upon it, and how ready to loſe their lives, or any thing that's dear to 'em, rather than part with thoſe truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in it.</p>
            <p>It were eaſie to prove <hi>Scripture</hi> equally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable to the greateſt <hi>ſtrangers to Chriſtianity</hi> with any other <hi>Humane writings</hi> whatſoever; For <hi>Heathens</hi> never pretended any ſuch ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for thoſe <hi>Writings</hi> they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to converſe with (how great names ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they bore in their titles) as to be afraid to oppoſe or confute them, and to diſtinguiſh among them between
<hi>truths</hi> and <hi>falſhoods,</hi> and proper ſubjects of
<hi>Credibility</hi> and <hi>Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility;</hi> for tho' the
<hi>Opinions</hi> of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were look'd upon as more rational than thoſe of others, and the <hi>Writings</hi> of ſome Hiſtorians as more Authentick, yet they were all acknowledged full of miſtakes, and naturally liable to ſuch; nay their very <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Writings,</hi> thoſe which they thought written, and which tradition told them were written by <hi>divine inſtinct,</hi> were frequently call'd in queſtion; and ſo their Poets the firſt Authors of their Divinity were generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted great
<hi>Fablers,</hi> and they deſerv'd it well; and their <hi>Sibyls</hi> whoſe <hi>Oracles</hi> were ſo much celebrated among them, were by
<hi>Tully</hi> in his 2d. Book <hi>de Divinatione,</hi> before
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:102432:152"/> the name of Chriſtians, or of Chriſt himſelf was heard in the World, cry'd down as a <hi>cheat</hi> for the moſt part; and where <hi>Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> (as ſome of thoſe ſo call'd) were inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that <hi>divine Original</hi> they pretended to; Which inſtance, whether
<hi>Tully</hi> were in the right or no, proves yet certainly the dubiouſneſs of Mens minds among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, as to the <hi>authority of their moſt ſacred and eſteem'd Writings,</hi> and how ſmall a Crime they held it to impeach any of them. Yet they valued many <hi>Authors</hi> ſo much, as to take a great deal of care to preſerve their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and to tranſmit them very carefully to Poſterity. Now to raiſe Scripture to this proportion of eſteem among them, no more needs to be alledg'd, than that the Subjects they treat on, are generally very good, as the Writings of any old Philoſophers could pretend to be; that though the Nation principally concern'd in it, was not ſo famous as many of the <hi>rufling or Politick founders</hi> of other large Empires were, yet there were ſuch a People really in the World as the <hi>Jews,</hi> and afterwards as the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> were; that they had Laws given them, and liv'd under particular forms of Government, and that the Hiſtorical account given of Jewiſh <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and <hi>Monarchs,</hi> and of the firſt
<hi>Founders</hi> of Chriſtianity, and their induſtry, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, were as Rational, and as likely to be true, as the Hiſtories of other
<hi>Political tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions;</hi> and a great deal more likely to be
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:102432:153"/> true in the eldeſt parts of its Hiſtory, as that of the World's Beginning, of the <hi>Long Lives</hi> of thoſe before the Flood, of the Flood it ſelf, and the <hi>eſcape</hi> of a very ſmall number from it, of the Reparation of the World by <hi>a new increaſe of Mankind,</hi> and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of the Original of that call'd the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> from the Conflagration of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha, Admah,</hi> and

<hi>dreams and forgeries of their eldeſt Authors,</hi> for whoſe ſake they look'd upon all their own ſtories, relating to the firſt Ages of the World, as onely <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>fabulous.</hi> Theſe Pleas, as I ſaid before, might ſerve to bring any into as good an opinion of that Book which we call Scripture, as of any other <hi>meer humane writing:</hi> But that's not enough; Scripture may, to <hi>Infidels</hi> themſelves, be prov'd to be far ſuperior in the <hi>original, nature and uſe of it,</hi> than any thing elſe the World pretends to; the certainty of which lays open a fair way for the converſion of Infidels to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and indeed is ſuch a medium, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, or <hi>unqueſtionable miracles,</hi> which
<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> too muſt tend wholly to the <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the authority of Scripture, it's wholly <pb n="287" facs="tcp:102432:153"/> vain to pretend to their converſion.</p>
            <p>What I mention'd at firſt, that the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Scripture</hi> might be prov'd, or its <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> have a due influence upon ſuch as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge onely <hi>the being of a God,</hi> was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with relation to Atheiſts, who deny any ſuch <hi>Being</hi> at all; for tho' we have not met yet with any Nation ſo barbarous, but it has had ſome
<hi>notion</hi> of a God, (as where-ever there is any pretence to
<hi>divination</hi> or <hi>predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of future contingencies,</hi> there muſt be ſuch) yet ſince ſome will pretend to <hi>Courage</hi> enough, utterly to deny the <hi>exiſtence of a God,</hi> and make it their buſineſs to make <hi>proſelytes</hi> to the ſame

            <p>That if there be a God, i. e. <hi>One great ſupreme Being, who preſides with an abſolute and illimited power over the World, and all tranſactions in it:</hi> This God muſt neceſſarily have all thoſe

The <hi>beginning,</hi> the
<hi>end,</hi> and the <hi>middle of all things.</hi> He who is one God onely and all Gods in one: now the reſult of all theſe titles is, <hi>That the Supreme Being which governs the World is infinitely perfect,</hi> which if drawn down into <hi>Chriſtian words and principles,</hi> amounts to this,
<hi>That God is infinitely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, juſt, true, merciful, glorious, loving and good to all his Creatures,</hi> and all theſe things are ſo
<hi>eſſentially conſtitutive of the Deity,</hi> that without the concurrence of them all, there could be none; for what is perfect, muſt be ſo in all inſtances, for any one exception ruines the whole aſſertion, and makes that Being, what ever he may pretend to really, imperfect.</p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe ſeveral Attributes which render God adorable to the World, that Love or Goodneſs of his whereby he <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and provides</hi> for all his Creatures is one, and as he originally

<hi>impertinent Writer,</hi> alledging Old Teſtaments-texts upon every
<hi>little hint,</hi> tho' never ſo <hi>far from the purpoſe;</hi> which argues very little reverence for an inſpired Writer: He tells us <hi>The name Immanuel could not ſignifie that Chriſt was God, becauſe the Prophet where he names him, ſays he was ſometime to be born, that he ſhould eat butter and honey, that he ſhould ſometime be ignorant of the difference between good and bad, &amp;c. therefore he could not be God;</hi> but all theſe things were and were <hi>neceſſarily</hi> true of him as he was Man, ſince he aſſumed a <hi>real</hi> and not a <hi>fantaſtick body.</hi> We know he was <hi>born in the fulneſs of time,</hi> taking fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that what was the dyet of other infants in thoſe parts of the world, was his too, that it might be evident to all the world he had aſſumed a <hi>real body</hi> like other men, in every thing but ſin; We believe his <hi>Humane Body</hi> grew and increas'd as that of other men, and that <hi>rational Soul</hi> joyned with his body, by which he was a <hi>true Man,</hi> had its advances in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho' at a greater and more early rate than others, all this we believe, and yet
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102432:175"/> Chriſt might be <hi>God</hi> and <hi>God with us</hi> for all this: For the reality of his <hi>Humanity</hi> was not any prejudice to the <hi>truth</hi> of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he was perfect Man and no leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God. Our adverſary queſtions farther <hi>whether the name Immanuel be here given to Chriſt or not,</hi> becauſe he finds him no where elſe called by that name: But neither was there any reaſon for that, this prophetical name being chiefly deſigned to ſignifie his <hi>Nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Enjed. in locum.</note> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to ſignifie his
<hi>Office,</hi> and ſince 'tis certain the name does belong to ſome body (for it's not put there for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) either it belongs to Chriſt, or that Author ought to have named ſome body to whom it did belong, but he is ſilent in that matter, therefore we conclude it belongs to the Son of God. He alledges farther, that <hi>ſuppoſing the name Immanuel be the name of Jeſus in the Text, it ſignifies no more, than that God was in and with him as he was with other of his Prophets:</hi> but that's impertinent, ſince the name doth not import that <hi>God was in or with him,</hi> but that, upon his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>God was with us, i. e.</hi> God did then aſſume fleſh and appear to and come among us, which could not be unleſs he were God. He tells us, <hi>Moſes</hi> might as well have been called <hi>Emmanuel</hi> while he converſt with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the Ark of God (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> expected to be ſaved by it, and upon its being brought into the field the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> cryed out,
<hi>God is come <pb n="327" facs="tcp:102432:175"/> into the Camp</hi>) but was
<hi>Moſes</hi> conceived of the Holy Ghoſt? was the Ark of God really a living Saviour? God might have given them what names himſelf pleas'd, but we no where find that he gave them <hi>this,</hi> which ſhews that he deſigned to appropriate this name wholly to his own Son, when he ſhould ſend him into the world, that under that very ſtate of exinanition or humiliation we ſhould ſee him, we ſhould know how great a Being converſt with us. What elſe he objects is abſurd even to ridiculouſneſs, <hi>viz. That many ſince that time, have born the name of Immanuel, and yet we never took them for gods,</hi> as ſeveral Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and many private men, among the reſt <hi>Immanuel Tremellius,</hi> as he inſtances, a learned Proteſtant of later years: He might as well have proved, that becauſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Jews</hi> and others have been called
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet none of them were <hi>Lawgivers to Iſrael,</hi> therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> the Son of <hi>Amram</hi> was no ſuch

<hi>was not to believe that</hi> Moſes <pb n="330" facs="tcp:102432:178"/> 
               <hi>was the moſt high God,</hi> and conſequently, <hi>That to be baptiſed into the name of the Son of God, is not to believe any ſuch thing of him,</hi> he forgets, that to be baptiſed into the name of the Father, is to declare our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of His being <hi>the moſt high God,</hi> by his own confeſſion: (yet <hi>that belief</hi> is the very Character by which thoſe Hereticks diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves from us, whom they call Trinitarians) and if that be own'd, our baptiſing in the name of Chriſt, muſt infer our acknowledgment of his Divinity, ſince the Father and the Son are joyned together in the ſame expreſſion, and we are baptiſed alike, and as much into the name and belief of one, as of the other. But they would prove that Chriſt is not <hi>here</hi> made <hi>equal with his Father,</hi> becauſe S.
<hi>Paul</hi> afterwards ranks him but with himſelf and others, as in his reproof of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for ſaying,<note place="margin">1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12</note> 
               <hi>I am of Paul and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Chriſt.</hi> Here indeed they confeſs <hi>there is a real ſuperiority in Chriſt to any of theſe mentioned with him:</hi> That acknowledgment was inevitable: But farther, tho' the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle condemn the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> for calling themſelves by <hi>his name,</hi> or the
<hi>name of any of his fellow labourers,</hi> yet he approves their calling themſelves <hi>by the name of Chriſt:</hi> for ſo he tells them with reſpect to Creatures and their circumſtances,<note place="margin">2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22 23.</note> 
               <hi>All are theirs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102432:178"/> to come, all are yours;</hi> but then he changes his ſtile, <hi>and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> and ſo he was,
<hi>the Meſſiah, the Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſent by God into the world.</hi> In concluſion they tell us, that theſe words were never deſigned as a
<hi>formulary of Baptiſm,</hi> which they prove, <hi>becauſe there is no account in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> particularly in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts, of any baptiſed by this form,</hi> but will they aſſert there was no form at all, no ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant words made uſe of in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of that ordinance? that would be to leave the meaning of the outward Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony uncertain, and to take away the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental nature of baptiſm; if there were
<hi>any words</hi> uſed, either they muſt <hi>allow theſe,</hi> or
<hi>aſſign ſome other,</hi> which none that I know of have attempted. It's true, they ſay, the <hi>Eunuch</hi> only declared to <hi>Philip,</hi> before his Baptiſm,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37.</note> that <hi>He believed Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God,</hi> and there was no need of more, <hi>Philip</hi> queſtioned not his <hi>belief of a God,</hi> He was a
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Proſelyte, and if he owned the <hi>Son-ſhip of Chriſt,</hi> he would by conſequence believe <hi>whatſoever ſhould be revealed to the world by him:</hi> But we read not of any words uſed by
<hi>Philip</hi> in the act of baptiſing him; they ſay this ſilence proves the words in the Text we are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, <hi>were not uſed:</hi> I ſay no, but Chriſt's <hi>particular inſtitution</hi> being very well known, and his diſciples <hi>uſing to obey</hi> his commands, <hi>S. Luke</hi>'s ſilence infers that <hi>Philip</hi> uſed <hi>thoſe <pb n="332" facs="tcp:102432:179"/> very words ſo inſtituted,</hi> otherwiſe the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt would have taken notice of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and thus after all, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, being joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>words of inſtitution</hi> in Chriſtian Baptiſm without any mark of inferiority, theſe words prove
<hi>the Son of God to be God equal with his Father.</hi>

<hi>before any thing, but the eternal God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had a being, God out of nothing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all things:</hi> and ſo <hi>before any thing, God excepted, had a being, the Word was:</hi> therefore that Word was God, becauſe God only could exiſt in the beginning or before the Creation of all things: and thus the Evangeliſt ſays ſomething peculiar of Chriſt, and what might really ſet him above the Baptiſt, or bleſſed Angels, or any other Creatures whatſoever: Otherwiſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, according to the
<hi>Socinian</hi> fancy, would have taken pains to prevent an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection never brought, at ſuch a time too as never any Man could have rais'd it, for he wrote his Goſpel, according to all accounts, about the 90th. year of our Saviour, toward the end of his own very long life, and when the Goſpel was ſpread in all quarters, and Hereſies had gotten a great footing in the Church, when that Objection about <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt would have appeared nonſenſical and ridiculous: Whereas, had he deſign'd his <hi>Maſter's honour</hi> or the <hi>advantage of mankind,</hi> he would have made haſte, and have pen'd his Goſpel very early, when ſuch poor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections might have appeared with ſome <pb n="336" facs="tcp:102432:181"/> countenance.

<hi>God,</hi> this <hi>Creator of all things,</hi> appeared upon Earth, where, even thoſe who were the Work of his hands, were grown to that Blindneſs through the greatneſs of their Sins, and the corruption of their natures, that tho' the whole Creation long'd for the glorious day of his

<hi>He has created all things viſible and inviſible, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaven or in the earth,</hi> that <hi>He has founded the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of his hands:</hi> if all theſe things are the <pb n="353" facs="tcp:102432:189"/> Characters of the moſt high God, Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour juſtly wears them all. <hi>He was in the beginning before all things, He was then with God, He was God, all things were made by him, and nothing without him, He made the World, and all things in it whether viſible or inviſible, &amp;c.</hi> therefore he was the moſt high God: notwithſtanding which <hi>exalted nature,</hi> he was pleas'd to manifeſt himſelf <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> or to become fleſh, which could be no diminution of his eternal glory, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity being abſolutely incapable of any ſuch leſſening; <hi>The Godhead was not converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fleſh,</hi> as the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed expreſſes it, <hi>i. e.</hi> by taking our Nature, the Son of God did not ceaſe to be God, <hi>but he took the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood into God,</hi> that which was limited and finite into that which was infinite.

<hi>Innocence of his life,</hi> where they could convince him of no Sin; how the <hi>purity of his Doctrine,</hi> which he uttered ſo as never Man did before him: how the <hi>greatneſs of his Miracles,</hi> which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable and extremely kind: did prove beyond contradiction of any, but thoſe who were wilfully mad, that He could be no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, no Cheat as they imagin'd: Had they been his Sheep, they'd have liſtned to him, and have been ſafe, for all thoſe were ſo who followed him, <hi>He would give them eternal life, and no man could take them out of his hand, for his Father</hi> who gave them him <hi>was greater than all,</hi> Therefore <hi>no man could pluck them out of his hand;</hi> but <hi>He and his Father were One,</hi> therefore <hi>none could pluck them out of his hand,</hi> therefore He too was greater than all.

<hi>Two to be One</hi> is often uſed for that <hi>unity or agreement of mind,</hi> which our adverſaries ſpeak of, but we may retort their queſtion, and ask, Is it poſſible two ſhould be exactly of one mind, and yet not both of one nature? I fear they'l find no inſtances of that: Friends may be ſaid to be One, Husband and Wife to be One, Two People to be One, but are they not all of a <hi>mortal nature,</hi> and conſequently capable of <hi>equal thoughts and apprehenſions</hi> of things? if therefore God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt be One in their ſence, it muſt be by

Indeed the Prayer of Chriſt imports only this, He begs of his Father that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might be as cloſely united with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their <hi>mortal ſtate,</hi> and in proportion to it, as he and his Father were in their <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Nature;</hi> and that believers ſhould enjoy his preſence as effectually to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, by their <hi>Faith in him,</hi> as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the infinite glory and happineſs of his Father, by his Identity or Coeſſentiality with him; and this is the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they could wiſh for themſelves, or Chriſt for them. The
<hi>Jews</hi> then were not miſtaken in the meaning of our Saviour, when in ſaying, <hi>He and his Father were one,</hi> they thought <hi>he made himſelf God:</hi> nor did they miſtake him, when they ſought to kill him before, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>God was his Father,</hi>

            <p>Let us then proceed farther to that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> when he called our Saviour <hi>his Lord and his God:</hi>

In this argument the Apoſtle makes uſe of ſuch expreſſions, as ſtumble the enemies of the <hi>Divinity of the Son of God</hi> very much, and give them a great deal of pains to ſhift off and to evade; ſo the <hi>form of God,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to be nothing but a <hi>reſemblance</hi> or

<hi>their being in the form of God.</hi> If it be objected, that
<hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and the Diſciples, after our Lord's Reſurrection, did indeed many and great <pb n="377" facs="tcp:102432:201"/> Miracles, but they were not done in their <hi>own names,</hi> we acknowledge it: but if our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries may be believed, our Saviour was in the ſame circumſtances, for his Miracles were only done in the <hi>name of God,</hi> and ſo were the Moſaic and Prophetic Miracles done. If they'l own that our Saviour did his Miracles in <hi>His own name,</hi> they grant what they take ſo much pains to diſprove, for none can do a Miracle in <hi>his own name,</hi> but he who has an <hi>inherent power</hi> in himſelf, commanding all the parts of the Creation, having no need of leave or aſſiſtance from any <hi>ſuperiour Being;</hi> but ſuch a power is and only can be inherent in the moſt high God, therefore if our Saviour had that power, <hi>he was and is the moſt high God,</hi> if he had not, he's in the ſame rank with other holy and good Men, and any of them might have been inſtanced in as patterns of as great conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and love to Souls as himſelf.

The <hi>Socinians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would have him be in the <hi>form of God,</hi> only on this account, <hi>becauſe all the parts of nature ſeem'd to obey him as their Lord and Maſter:</hi> the Prophets too had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them before; but ſome things were done by our Saviour of ſo <hi>ſingular a nature,</hi> as the greateſt of the Prophets could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to nothing of that kind. Thus when <hi>Jacob</hi> was afraid of
<hi>Eſau,</hi> he wreſtled with God in Prayer, and God turn'd the heart of
<hi>Eſau</hi> towards his brother, and took off thoſe barbarous and revengeful thoughts he had entertained before; ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> eſcaped his fury. <hi>Moſes</hi> when terrified with the anger of the king of
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> fled for it, <pb n="382" facs="tcp:102432:204"/> and ſav'd himſelf: and ſo <hi>Elijah</hi> himſelf was forced to flight that he might eſcape the feminine rage of <hi>Jezebel;</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets, how great and conſiderable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had only <hi>flight</hi> or <hi>ſufferings</hi> to prepare for. It was otherwiſe with our Saviour: for when he had enraged the people of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> by ſpeaking what was <hi>true</hi> and
<hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to them, and they reſolv'd to put an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual end to His preaching, who could flatter them no better, <hi>they thruſt him out of the City, they lead him,</hi> to be ſure, with Guard ſtrong and numerous enough, <hi>to the brow of the Hill on which their City was built:</hi> their deſign was <hi>to caſt him down headlong</hi> (not to <hi>perſwade</hi> him to caſt <hi>himſelf</hi> down,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 4.29,

We meet not with any
<hi>interpoſition of Angels,</hi> no <hi>blindneſs</hi> laid upon them as a penalty, but He went from amongſt them, they no more able to
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:102432:204"/> oppoſe his Motions, than <hi>a Man in a dream</hi> would be able to fight a Duel with <hi>a waking and terrible adverſary;</hi> here then <hi>Almighty power</hi> ſhew'd it ſelf even in <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> he ſhew'd his enemies how <hi>inviſible,</hi> how every way <hi>indiſcernible Humane Nature aſſumed into the Divine,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be. The <hi>Turks,</hi> perhaps taking their hint from this paſſage, tell us, that <hi>when our Saviour was led to be crucified, he vaniſhed, in the ſame ſurpriſing manner, out of their hands, and left them only to exerciſe their rage upon one of his Judges,</hi> of whom they ſay, <hi>that he reſembled Chriſt in an extraordinary manner.</hi> An <hi>humane body</hi> acted meerly by a <hi>rational ſoul,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be perceptible by thoſe who compaſſed it round, and could they once have been ſenſible of his motions, it had been eaſie to have ſtayed him, but, where a <hi>divine Power</hi> interpos'd, it was impoſſible for any to obſerve, or at leaſt to obſerve with a capacity to hinder his moving. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> tells us, how <hi>Venus</hi> wrapt her ſon <hi>Aeneas</hi> with his companion <hi>Achates</hi> in a <hi>miſty robe,</hi> but he brings him on the ſtage of <hi>Carthage</hi> in the ſame
<hi>inviſible circumſtances,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were no offers to hinder him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where he would, but when he was once ſeen, his Mother her ſelf was not able to muffle him up ſo from humane eyes, as that he ſhould fall into no danger: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Homer</hi> makes both <hi>Mars</hi> and
<hi>Venus,</hi> the laſt not viſible at the time, to be wounded
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:102432:205"/> by <hi>Diomedes,</hi> when he was ſo very eager in purſuit of the <hi>Trojans:</hi> This then in our Saviour prov'd his
<hi>rank</hi> yet <hi>higher</hi> than that of Man, his <hi>Power greater</hi> and more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as working of it ſelf, ſo upon humane Spirits, that either they could not diſcern him at all, or had no power to ſhew their diſpleaſure, tho' never ſo violent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful before; there needed no Angel here to <hi>ſtop the Lyons mouths,</hi> his Will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any outward expreſſion of it was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And thus he ſhew'd a
<hi>Power</hi> equally <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> when meerly by asking the Officers who came with that Traitor <hi>Judas</hi> to take him, <hi>whom they ſought?</hi> and telling them that <hi>He himſelf was the Perſon,</hi>

<hi>blood and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> are not wont to be affrighted with one anothers looks or words, but God even <hi>in the ſtill ſmall voice</hi> is to be fear'd. We muſt neceſſarily conclude that he who was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who was <hi>his only Son,</hi> that Son to whom he gave ſo extraordinary a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that <hi>in him he was well pleaſed,</hi> we muſt conclude, that this Son would take all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to advance the honour of his Father; that He'd not only forbid others doing any thing that might detract from it, but he'd be above all things careful not to do any thing of ſo impious a complexion himſelf. <pb n="385" facs="tcp:102432:205"/> As this was a duty incumbent upon every ſervant of God, ſo we find the Prophets al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways careful in the caſe, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing all thoſe Miracles they wrought with <hi>ſolemn Prayers,</hi> and with the <hi>name of that God</hi> from whom all their <hi>miracle-working power</hi> was derived.
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to have fail'd a little only in the point, when he was to bring <hi>water out of the rock</hi> for the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> but
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſin'd; nor could the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of his zeal</hi> excuſe him from a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere puniſhment on that account. But, if we run over the general Hiſtories of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's miracles, we find
<hi>Him,</hi> for ought is upon record, not at all careful upon this matter; He does them frequently, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be regiſtred, but all in his own name: He
<hi>Wills</hi> this, and He <hi>Commands</hi> the other thing to be done, ſo the Winds, the Waves, the various Diſtempers afflicting Mankind, the Devils themſelves tremble at and obey his Word; the Dead riſe at the hearing of his Voice, every thing he ſpeaks is <hi>powerful and authentick,</hi> yet no Praying before, no making uſe of his Father's name, no more notice taken of him in the operation, than as if the Father and the Son had ſtood in no kind of relation to one another. Nay, even in the caſe of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which, if any, muſt carry the face of an exception; We ſee our Saviour praiſing his Father indeed <hi>for his readineſs to hear him,</hi> yet expreſſing himſelf ſo <hi>only for their ſakes that were by:</hi>

Here then we are reduced to a neceſſity, either of ſaying with the blaſpheming <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>He had a devil,</hi> and only by
<hi>his power wrought all his miracles;</hi> and that Almighty God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of power to hinder him, or out of deſign to have Mankind deluded and abus'd to their own ruine, permitted him to do ſo many wonderful works: Or elſe, that the bleſſed Jeſus was really that <hi>holy, meek, juſt, eternal Son of the eternal God,</hi> that he aſſumed no more to himſelf, than what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally belong'd to him, therefore that he had really power in himſelf, and <hi>originated from himſelf, to do whatſoever he pleaſed,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he was God, <hi>the true, the moſt high God.</hi> That we may be the better aſſured <pb n="387" facs="tcp:102432:206"/> that his
<hi>Power</hi> was ſo <hi>innate and inherent,</hi> we may obſerve, that whereas his Apoſtles, after his aſcent, did many miracles, and thoſe of an extraordinary nature; ſo that <hi>Aprons and Handkerchiefs brought from the body of S.</hi> Paul, and the <hi>very ſhadow of S.</hi> Peter, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a healing power with them, yet there was nothing in all <hi>that</hi> equal to what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our Saviour upon the Woman's cure of her <hi>bloody Iſſue,</hi> who had but <hi>touched the hem of his garment:</hi> The Apoſtles utterly diſown'd the working any cures by any power of their own, therein they acted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly and piouſly; but on the contrary, our Saviour aſcribes the miraculous cure done upon the woman, only to Himſelf; he takes notice of his <hi>garment,</hi> and, by it, of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being touch'd,</hi> and that at ſuch a time as a <hi>croud of people thronged him,</hi> and he ſays, not that his Father's power, or the hand of God, or any thing of that nature, was gone out to cure her.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity</hi> attending <hi>a perfect univerſal knowledge of the thoughts of all,</hi> which a Body can never be capable of; If then the knowledge of Chriſt in reference to the Hearts of men, was
<hi>equal</hi> with God's, if it were impoſſible for him to be deceived, if it was no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in him to aſcribe to himſelf this peculiar Attribute of the moſt high God, He then muſt be equal with God, therefore he muſt be the True God.</p>
            <p>If we reflect upon our Lord's behaviour <hi>after</hi> his Reſurrection before his Aſcent into Heaven, if he be no more than <hi>a meer man,</hi> it's wholly unaccountable. The Holy Ghoſt is by the
<hi>Socinians</hi> denyed to be a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or to be <hi>God;</hi> yet it's allowed by them to be <hi>the power of God, a virtue flowing out of or from the Supreme Deity,</hi> under this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may rationally aſſert, that this Holy Spirit can be commanded no way but by the Supreme God himſelf, none elſe can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it, none can give it; for if the Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets, <pb n="395" facs="tcp:102432:210"/> much more certainly muſt the Spirit of God be ſubject to him, it ſubſiſting wholly in him, and being according to our Adverſaries, one of thoſe
<hi>qualifications</hi> neceſſarily in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God: Granting all this, if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was a <hi>meer man,</hi> as they ſay, he could not poſſibly command this Sacred Spirit, this Spirit ſo much ſuperiour to
<hi>mankind,</hi> tho' conſidered as no more than a meer <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> to the Almighty. Yet our Saviour ſeems to employ this Spirit as he will; that's no wonder, if the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt tho' <hi>three perſons</hi> be all <hi>one God:</hi> That exact concurrence in their eternal wills taking away all difficulties: Thus when the Lord met with his Diſciples, and ſhew'd them the neceſſity of things happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with relation to himſelf, as they did, then <hi>He opened their underſtandings that they might underſtand the Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.45</note> this <hi>opening their underſtandings,</hi> did not conſiſt barely in explaining ſome particular Texts to them; they were yet but very <hi>dull and ſlow of underſtanding</hi> in themſelves, and tho' they had heard a thouſand Texts authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally explain'd, they might have continued <hi>very inapprehenſive</hi> ſtill: Nor is it an uſual manner of ſpeech to ſay, when a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains any Author to others, that he <hi>opens their underſtandings;</hi> he may open the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch or ſuch Books, or Paſſages very well, yet thoſe who hear him may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in their intellectuals; this <hi>opening <pb n="396" facs="tcp:102432:211"/> their underſtandings</hi> therefore argued ſome <hi>force</hi> upon their minds, ſome extraordinary <hi>Energy</hi> of the Spirit within them, whereby their natural and inveterate Dulneſs went off, and they had more of ſpritelineſs and vigour in their Souls than formerly: they ſeem'd as Slaves with their fetters knockt off, nimble and active, and therefore more capable of apprehending any thing offered to them than formerly. This was the firſt beginning to fit them for that <hi>great work</hi> they were in a few days to engage in, it was to make them capable of ſatisfying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves gradually in the Truth and Reaſon of thoſe things which they were afterwards to <hi>preach to the world abroad,</hi> and which they were compleatly fitted for by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>extraordinary effuſions</hi> of that Holy Spirit upon them; The firſt operations of it upon them then were
<hi>gentle and eaſie,</hi> but it was the operation of that Sacred Spirit only, and of that Spirit as ordered by the bleſſed Jeſus, by which their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were thus opened. We may agree to this the more eaſily, if we conſider that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Chriſt makes to his Diſciples after this,
<hi>Behold I ſend the promiſe of my father upon you,</hi>

               <hi>that after his Reſurrection the body of Chriſt was of mortal nature, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe partaker of immortality, than by the will of his Father:</hi> Now if this be true, tho' God Almighty be able of and from himſelf to give an

               <hi>Supreme,</hi> but in ſuch a one as is ſtill, tho' highly exalted,
<hi>mortal in its own nature, and capable of deſtruction or annihilation:</hi> For if it depends only on God's Will, that Chriſt's Body, now exalted to the right hand of his Father, is <hi>no more lyable to Death,</hi> then, had it pleaſed God, he might have inveſted
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or <hi>Enoch</hi> with <hi>this ſame Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence</hi> as well as our Saviour, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is no more ſecure of the continuation of that Omnipotence he is at preſent poſſeſt of, in himſelf, than the good Angels are of continuing in their preſent ſtate of bliſs, <hi>i.e. ſo long as the ſupreme God upholds them they are ſafe; if He withdraw, but for one moment, they are as miſerable as their fallen companions.</hi> But the very thought of theſe things are abſurd and blaſphemous, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever not to be avoided without acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eternal Divinity of the Son of God.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For the farther evidence of this Truth we muſt look into the <hi>Faith of the Antient Church,</hi> and ſee how this Doctrine, that <hi>God was manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> or that, <hi>He who was manifeſt in the fleſh was God,</hi> the <hi>True,</hi> the
<hi>Supreme,</hi> the <hi>moſt High God,</hi> is aſſerted in it. This inquiry we make, not becauſe we think <hi>Antiquity infallible,</hi> nor becauſe we imagine every <hi>opinion,</hi> maintained by any Father of the Church, ought to be an <hi>authentick preſcription</hi> to us. Where any of them have in any particular deviated from <pb n="410" facs="tcp:102432:218"/> the ſence of God's holy Word, we value not their <hi>opinions</hi> a-whit the more for their being <hi>antient.</hi> But this we muſt own, that thoſe who lived
<hi>neareſt</hi> the times of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apoſtles, had the
<hi>beſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities</hi> of knowing what they meant, or how thoſe, who
<hi>perſonally converſt with them</hi> underſtood them; as it's eaſier for me, who have ſeen and known my Father, to learn from him what were the thoughts of my Grandfather, or great Grandfather, both which it may be my Father may have ſeen and converſt with, than to find out what particular Opinions were entertained by my Predeceſſors before the Conqueſt, and ſo upwards. Again, where Scripture, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon improved from thence, give us a full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of any truth, the concurrence and harmony of Antiquity with theſe evidences, is of great weight, and gives us a fair de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of
<hi>divine and neceſſary Truths</hi> thro' all ages, and ſhews us how, in ſpite of all the <hi>oppoſitions and artifices</hi> made uſe of by the enemies of Truth, yet God has been pleaſed to preſerve <hi>it</hi> entire, and to derive <hi>it</hi> by various chanels down to us, that we, embracing and aſſerting the ſame Holy Faith, may be partakers of the ſame eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs with our predeceſſors, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, who have all dyed in the True Faith and fear of God; on this conſideration we ſhall, by God's aſſiſtance, give you a ſhort account <pb n="411" facs="tcp:102432:218"/> of the <hi>Primitive Faith</hi> in this particular: Here then in due order of time</p>

<hi>extraordinary dignity</hi> of our Saviour, for, by ſo ſetting him off, the Apoſtolical writer enforces his argument upon the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> to perſwade them to <hi>Humility,</hi> which would be an excellent foundation for <pb n="412" facs="tcp:102432:219"/> Charity, for, tho' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt were ſo great, tho' he were <hi>the Scepter of the greatneſs of God,</hi> yet he came not, as he might, in an <hi>aſſuming and lofty manner,</hi> but with the greateſt Humility, and this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his commentary on the 52 of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the three laſt verſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our tranſlation, makes uſe of to the ſame purpoſe, owning
<hi>Clement</hi> for his Author; but now, if the Argument of theſe great Men was good, it muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that our Saviour had a

               </note> the very firſt words of which give us a full proof of the doctrine we now aſſert. <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſays the Writer, <hi>We ought to think concerning Jeſus Chriſt as concerning God, as concerning the Judge both of the quick and the dead:</hi> If we muſt think of Chriſt as of God, we muſt think and believe that <hi>he is God,</hi> for <hi>ſo we</hi> think always of the <hi>Supreme Being:</hi> But theſe paſſages are ſufficient from an Author of ſo great antiquity.

In Him we meet with many evidences of his belief, that Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, was <hi>the real, the True God.</hi> So in the very firſt words of his firſt Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> He begins,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Smyrn.

In the concluſion of his Letter to <hi>Polycarp,</hi> then Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> (the ſame who is called the Angel of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> by S. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> who dyed afterwards a Martyr for the truth) he gives <hi>Polycarp</hi> this ſalutation, <hi>I pray that Grace may be always with thee in Jeſus Chriſt our God;</hi>

<hi>ſame Faith,</hi> in that reſpect, with himſelf; So that the <hi>real Deity</hi> of the Son of God, was no ſtrange Doctrine in thoſe days. In the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his next Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> He ſtiles that Church <hi>predeſtinated from the beginning,</hi>

<hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh, as <hi>Juſtine</hi> affirms, and Scripture ſufficiently evidences, if it were <hi>our Chriſt,</hi> what name ſoever he might be call'd by, he then was pre-exiſtent, or had a <hi>real being</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was conceived in the womb of the bleſſed Virgin; therefore he could be no <hi>meer Man,</hi> unleſs the <hi>Socinians</hi> can find out the way to ſatisfie the queſtion of <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> by aſſerting poſitively, <hi>that a Man,</hi> a meer Man, <hi>may be born when he is old, that he may,</hi> literally, <hi>enter again into his mothers womb and be born a-new,</hi> and can prove it when they have aſſerted it.

<hi>Bacchus</hi> for finding out the uſe of Wine, <hi>Ceres</hi> for Bread,
<hi>Minerva</hi> for Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the mean time
<hi>Arnobius</hi> openly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough acknowledges, that Chriſtians did receive Chriſt as God: He ſpeaks yet more plainly ſoon after,
<q rend="margQuotes">Chriſt for his <pb n="453" facs="tcp:102432:239"/> benefits ought to be called God: Nay, He really is God, without any ſcruple or ambiguity; and would you have us deny him Worſhip, or diſown his Government? But will ſome angry Pagan cry out, <hi>is Chriſt a God?</hi> We anſwer, he is God, and a God of infinite Power too, and (which will more exaſperate an infidel) he was ſent from the ſupreme King to us, upon the greateſt errand in the World: Perhaps the Pagan, being more enraged at this, will demand a Proof of what we ſay; there needs certainly no greater proof of
<hi>Chriſt's Divinity,</hi> than an exact examination of his actions. If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that <hi>He was a Magician, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his mighty works only by unlawful arts,</hi> Let them who object this ſhew us any of their Magicians, who ever did any thing like what was done by Chriſt: or if they have done any thing of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious nature, it has ſtill been by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſome other Being: but Chriſt, without any Helps, without any Magick Rites or Obſervations, did all he did by the power of <hi>his own Name;</hi> and what was proper and agreeable to, and worthy of a True God, nothing he did was hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or miſchievous, but helpful, ſaving, and the kind effects of divine Bounty: And was he Mortal? was he only <hi>one of us,</hi> at whoſe ordinary commands Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Sickneſſes, Fevers and all bodily
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:102432:240"/> Pains were gone at once? Was he <hi>one of us,</hi>

<q rend="margQuotes">Chriſt was the <hi>high God,</hi> the God from the beginning, a God ſent from unknown kingdoms, God ſent by the Prince of all things, to be the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Saviour; whom neither the Sun nor Stars, if they have any ſence, nor the Governours, nor Princes of this World, nor thoſe mighty Gods, who (aſſuming that terrible name) affright poor mortal creatures, were able to find out, or ſo much as to gueſs what He was, or whence He <pb n="455" facs="tcp:102432:240"/> came; at whoſe very look, then when he was clothed with fleſh,<note place="margin">

               <q rend="margQuotes">Where we ſay the Father is God, and the Son is God, we do not ſay they are different Gods, nor do we ſeparate them one from another, for neither can the Father be divided from the Son, nor the Son from the Father; for the Father in a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſence, cannot be named without the Son, nor the Son be begotten without the Father: Since then the Father makes the Son relatively, and the Son the Father, they have both one Mind, one Spirit, one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, only the Father is as an exuberant Spring, the Son as a ſtream flowing from it: the Father is as the Sun in the firmament, the Son as the rays beaming from that Sun; who, becauſe he is dear and faithful to his Father, can no more be ſeparated from him, than the ſtream from the Spring, or beams from the body of the Sun; for the water of the fountain is in the ſtream, and the light of the Sun in thoſe rays which iſſue from it: <pb n="458" facs="tcp:102432:242"/> And this is plain and pertinent enough.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And thus have I gone thro' the Writings of thoſe firſt Fathers, who are of the greateſt Name and Reputation, for their <hi>learning and piety</hi> in the Churches of God: I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd on this account, only ſuch Men as lived before the <hi>Arrian</hi> controverſie was on foot, ſo that they cannot be ſuſpected of partiality in the caſe, and either we muſt believe theſe Men knew very well what was the <hi>General Belief</hi> of Chriſtians in thoſe earlieſt ages, or they did not; if they did not underſtand what the Catholick Faith really was, we are all ſtrangely in the dark, and the <hi>Socinians</hi> are no more capable of giving an account of the Faith of the primo-primitive Church in contradiction to what we now aſſert, than we are in agreeance to it; nay, there lye all the preſumptions in the World againſt <hi>them</hi> in the point; for all the Writers, extant afterwards, with <hi>an almoſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal conſent,</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt them: So that unleſs the true Chriſtian Faith were entirely loſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of the great Nicene Council, the

<hi>Semi-Arrians,</hi> yet really they agree exactly with none of them, as might eaſily be prov'd by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their opinions together. Now if
<hi>Artemon,</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Photinus,</hi> and the reſt, were ſuch <hi>very great Men</hi> in all reſpects, and ſuch <hi>careful preſervers of the true Apoſtolical Faith,</hi> in thoſe things wherein they agree with the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, why ſhould not we believe they uſed as exact a care, and were as certainly in the right, in thoſe particulars wherein they differ'd from them? for doubtleſs ſuch
<hi>Good Men</hi> would not admit of any Errors in any points of weighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concern.

<hi>unreaſonable and damnable Errors:</hi> They only laid ſo many ſnares in their <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Writings,</hi> for the ruining mens Souls, and their wicked deſigns have had but too too fatal effects upon the World. Now all this is very hard to believe of Men, who converſt with the inſpired Apoſtles, ſome of whom had that glorious power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles confer'd upon them, ſome laid down their Lives, with the greateſt joys, and triumphs for the ſake of their bleſſed Maſter, and the reſt were ready to have done ſo, whenſoever Providence ſhould have ſummoned them to that fiery tryal. It's hard to believe that ſuch Men could be
<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers or corrupters of the Faith in its moſt Eſſential Articles.</hi> If theſe Fathers were honeſt and faithful in their Writings, and ſet down there only what were their real thoughts, as became honeſt and good Men, <pb n="461" facs="tcp:102432:243"/> if they defended Chriſtianity againſt its ſubtle and powerful enemies with a juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Integrity, then, in what I have alledged from them, we have a faithful and honeſt account of what the Antient Church believed concerning the Nature of the Son of God, and we have reaſon to ſatisfie our ſelves, and to give praiſe to God, who has ſtill afforded us ſo much light, as that we can agree with the Eldeſt and moſt Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Churches in that ſaving truth, <hi>That the Son of God, who in fulneſs of time took upon him our fleſh, is really God equal with his Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any ſhould enquire Why I only make uſe of thoſe Fathers who lived before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council? The reaſon is, becauſe they are leſs to be ſuſpected by thoſe we have to do with, as having no intereſt in thoſe Controverſies, which were afterwards managed by particular Perſons, with a great deal of heat and eagerneſs. Beſides, the
<hi>Socinians</hi> are ſometimes apt to boaſt, that the moſt antient Fathers are on their ſide, whereas they'l freely own the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Writers</hi> afterwards are againſt them; not but that ſeveral did undertake the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of the <hi>Arrians</hi> and their accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, after the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> but their Writings are gone, and they ly there at the mercy of their Adverſaries. Not only the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves are apt ſometimes to Appeal to the <hi>Ante-Nicene</hi> Fathers, but
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:102432:244"/> ſeveral Great Men, ſuch as <hi>Eraſmus, Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Petavius,</hi> and others, are apt to yield this to them: therefore it was proper in the firſt place, to give a true account of the firſt Writers, whoſe Doctrines others afterwards did but repeat and illuſtrate. Our Church principally recommends to us the <hi>Doctrine that's neareſt to the fountain head, that</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing beſt with the fountain it ſelf, from which it is derived, that is <hi>the Word of God.</hi> Now the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſometimes would fain put in for an Intereſt with theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Writers,<note place="margin">Vid.

<hi>greateſt part</hi> of the World embraced it, nor was it held perpetually by any; and tho' we may allow <hi>Socinus</hi> to have been a man of great Reaſon, yet we may allow thoſe who held the contrary Opinion to His, to have been as Rational as himſelf, and perhaps, on a ſtrict ſcrutiny, it may appear, <hi>contradictious to reaſon and common ſence,</hi> to aſſert <hi>that our bleſſed Saviour was no more than a meer Man.</hi> But in ſhort, <hi>Socinus</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubles himſelf to deny thoſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Jeſuite had ramaſsed from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor to anſwer them, but makes uſe of one <hi>Herculean Argument</hi> againſt them all, for firſt he tells us,
<q rend="margQuotes">It can't be ſaid, the whole doctrine or the greateſt part of the doctrine of the antient Church was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> or agreeable to the Doctrine of their Adverſaries; for there were many, whoſe Writings are now wholly loſt, whoſe opinions therefore we cannot judge of; and many there were, who never wrote any thing at all; and they might be of a contrary mind to thoſe <pb n="464" facs="tcp:102432:245"/> whoſe Writings we ſtill have, and they were infinitely more numerous: That the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie was once ſpread far and wide, favoured by Princes, confirmed by Councils, and almoſt generally entertained, tho' afterwards by degrees it vaniſh'd, therefore, <hi>ſays He,</hi> our Adverſaries need not boaſt of that <hi>univerſal and perpetual conſent of the Church;</hi> whether it were real or verbal; for <hi>which</hi> was

As for the Fathers who writ after the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> he fairly owns, that the
<hi>Socinian</hi>'s buſineſs is to oppoſe thoſe Errors, which they gave credit to by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church of God. The Fathers then are on our ſide, whether thoſe of the <hi>eldeſt,</hi> or thoſe of an <hi>inferior date;</hi> nor can we deſire a greater advantage to our cauſe, ſince we can neither find out any means by which theſe Hereticks ſhould know God's Will and Meaning in his Word, better than theſe Antient and Heroick Aſſertors of the Chriſtian Religion: We have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any new Viſions or Revelations, any of them have had: Nor have we heard of any Miracles perform'd by them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation <pb n="466" facs="tcp:102432:246"/> of their Heterodoxies; therefore when we believe <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, our Saviour, is God equal with his Father;</hi> we follow that truth, which, to our apprehenſion, is very plain in Scripture, which holy Saints and Martyrs have from the very beginning of Chriſtianity embrac'd, and which really is <hi>That Faith which was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> as God willing will yet more plainly appear hereafter.</p>
            <p>I obſerve here by the way what <hi>Socinus</hi> touches upon, and what others of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples allege farther, that tho' the Fathers do thus make <hi>Jeſus Chriſt to be God,</hi> yet they always put <hi>a great difference between Him and his Father,</hi> and inſiſt particularly on his own Words in the caſe, where He tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> That <hi>his Father is greater than He,</hi> that, <hi>his Father orders, commands, directs and enables Him to do every thing, &amp;c.</hi> It's true they do ſometimes ſpeak ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiouſly in this matter; but what ſolves the Objection from ſuch Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſolves thoſe Objections which may be drawn from ſuch expreſſions in thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Writers, <hi>viz.</hi> That,

If then theſe Fathers did think Chriſt to be <hi>a God of an inferior or ſubordinate Nature,</hi> or to be a <hi>Created God,</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have him be, they directly contradicted their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and brought in again that
<hi>multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>plurality of Gods,</hi> they had before exploded. As for the notion of <hi>a made or created God,</hi> or a God,
<hi>à parte poſt,</hi> as <hi>Socinus</hi> calls him, it's a dream ſo ſenceleſs and full of contradiction, that it's only to be wondered at, that Men pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any ſharpneſs of Reaſon ſhould ever ſtumble upon ſo abſurd a conceit: For Scripture no where makes a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God ſelf-originated, and God made by another,</hi> and <hi>both true:</hi> but it lays us down a plain difference between the true God <hi>the Creator</hi> and the <hi>Creature,</hi> or any thing that is created by that true God, and therefore tho' there be in Nature ſuch things as <hi>Spiritual and Corporeal Beings,</hi> yet the allowance of that difference makes or introduces <hi>no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Beings between the Creator and the Creature, every thing that is not God, is <pb n="469" facs="tcp:102432:247"/> made by God; every thing that's made by God is not God;</hi> and ſo it muſt follow, that, <hi>if the Son be made by God, he is not God, but a Creature; if the Son be in all particulars equal with God, he is not made by God, but is God himſelf.</hi> Again, The notion of <hi>a true</hi> and <hi>real God</hi> is <hi>infinity in every reſpect,</hi> Heathens, Jews, Mahumetans, Chriſtians, all agree in that: if this be a true notion of <hi>a real God,</hi> it muſt be ſuch a notion, as muſt ſufficiently diſtinguiſh him from all other Beings, infinite Attributes being wholly and only <hi>proper to</hi> and
<hi>inſeparable from Him:</hi> If then theſe <hi>infinite attributes</hi> do agree to our Lord and Saviour, <hi>He is and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be the true God,</hi> in contradiſtinction to all <hi>created Beings;</hi> if they do not agree to him, then <hi>He cannot be the true God,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>he muſt be a falſe God,</hi> therefore <hi>he muſt be an Idol,</hi> therefore
<hi>he muſt be no God at all,</hi> and this is the true and inevitable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the <hi>Socinian</hi> notion of <hi>a made or a Created God:</hi> For that the <hi>Supreme God</hi> ſhould make another <hi>ſupreme as himſelf,</hi> and yet at the ſame time continue <hi>ſupreme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> is nonſenſe and a contradiction; that the <hi>Supreme God</hi> ſhould make <hi>another God,</hi> who <hi>yet is no God,</hi> becauſe the attributes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>a real God</hi> are not applicable to Him, is a contradiction too; therefore the <hi>Socinians</hi> and their Adherents, muſt either declare in plain and expreſs words, that <hi>our Saviour is no God at all,</hi> either <hi>à parte ante,</hi>
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:102432:248"/> with reſpect to the time paſt, or before his Incarnation, or <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> with reſpect to the time to come, or after his Incarnation, but only a <hi>meer glorified Man:</hi> or they muſt agree with us, that <hi>He is God eternal equal with his Father,</hi> as
<hi>true</hi> and as <hi>real God,</hi> as ever he was <hi>true and real Man:</hi> and this is what thoſe antient Fathers did certainly agree with, and in all thoſe paſſages I have quoted from them, they muſt believe ſo, or be abſolutely inconſiſtent with themſelves; and all thoſe, who were their ſucceſſors ſoon after in the Government of the Church of Chriſt, muſt have ſtrangely miſtaken them and their opinions, which yet is not ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it is, that <hi>modern Writers</hi> ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand them.

<pb n="496" facs="tcp:102432:261"/> be beſtow'd upon them. I have gone the farther in clearing this Text from <hi>Socinian</hi> ſophiſtry, becauſe from hence a clear and undeniable argument may be drawn againſt applying Divine Worſhip to any Creature: for, if all Created Beings are really <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to vanity,</hi> and <hi>wait</hi> themſelves <hi>for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> with a mighty expectation; whatſoever addreſſes are made to them, as they muſt neceſſarily be vain and fruitleſs, ſo they muſt fall under the charge of groſs Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and if our Saviour be no more than <hi>a meer Creature,</hi> then, as before I alledged, He being ſubject to the ſame vanity, all <hi>Worſhip or adorations offered up to him,</hi> muſt fall under the ſame denomination and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. In a word, nothing can be the
<hi>proper object of Divine Worſhip,</hi> but what is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, Omniſcient, and Omnipreſent, theſe attributes are only applicable to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God, therefore Divine Worſhip ought only to be preſented to Him: if theſe things concur in our Saviour, He's <hi>the True, the Supreme</hi> God, and ſo all Honour and Glory belongs to him; if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur not in him, He's but a Creature, no more, therefore all <hi>divine Worſhip</hi> offered to him, under what plauſible pretences ſoever, is vain, fruitleſs and Idolatrous.</p>
            <p>But this Queſtion about <hi>Worſhipping our Saviour</hi> or
<hi>Preſenting our Prayers to him,</hi> has created no ſmall Fraction among the <hi>Anti-Trinitarians</hi> themſelves. You heard <pb n="497" facs="tcp:102432:261"/> before the declaration of their Catechiſm, which ought to contain the

Chriſt in his Humane Nature is the <pb n="500" facs="tcp:102432:263"/> head of the Church; in his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he has the Government of it in his hands, in his Humane Nature all power in Heaven and in Earth is his own, but none of theſe things are his <hi>meerly as he is Man,</hi> or as he is a Creature, but <hi>that Humane or Created Nature of Chriſt, is made capable of thoſe things of which in its own Nature</hi> it was abſolutely incapable,
<hi>by its entire</hi> Union <hi>with,</hi> and <hi>ſubſiſtenee in the Godhead.</hi> Without owning this, our Prayers to Chriſt, as thoſe offer'd by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to Saints or Angels, are meer mock devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if Chriſt, <hi>before</hi> his Aſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, had no Exiſtence but in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in <hi>meer fleſh and blood,</hi> then
<hi>after</hi> his Aſcenſion he likewiſe had no exiſtence but in the ſame Body; if he exiſted in the ſame Body, he could be partaker of no other qualifications but ſuch as are incident to a Body; for if his
<hi>natural Body</hi> could be partaker of ſuch qualifications as a
<hi>natural body</hi> was not capable of, it could be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the <hi>ſame body he was rais'd with,</hi> but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and that <hi>no natural body:</hi> If he ſtill exiſted in Heaven in that <hi>ſame body</hi> he roſe and aſcended with, and it was not changed to or for another, no attributes wholly or eſſentially Divine, could be truely or properly aſcribed to him: therefore Chriſt could not be Almighty, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power or Almightineſs yet is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary in him who has <hi>all Power
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:102432:263"/> given to him, both in heaven and earth,</hi> and <hi>who is able to do every thing,</hi> that can tend to their good, or to God's glory for them that ask him. Chriſt in his Natural Body cannot <hi>know all things,</hi> without which Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Knowledge yet it's impoſſible he ſhould ſuit all grants to the neceſſities of Petitioners, or be aſſiſtant to thoſe who lie under a natural incapacity to addreſs themſelves to him otherwiſe, than in their thoughts and inward wiſhes. Chriſt in his Natural Body cannot be Omnipreſent, he cannot be in more places than one, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bodies are and muſt be circumſcribed by Time and Place, otherwiſe they loſe their natures, and become God, for only God can exiſt without thoſe circumſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Time and Place: which Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence yet is indiſpenſably neceſſary to every one, who can
<hi>receive Petitions</hi> offered to him in ſeveral quarters of the World at once. If now the <hi>Socinians</hi> will deny theſe things to be inconſiſtent with a Natural Body, if they'l aſſert that a Created body may be <hi>Almighty,</hi> that it may <hi>know all things,</hi> that it may be
<hi>every where preſent,</hi> they muſt introduce a new and yet unheard of Philoſophick and Theologick Scheme, and to little purpoſe. If they'l ſay,
<hi>theſe things are needleſs to our Saviour's natural body,</hi> for that he may read all the wants of Petitioners, in all parts of the World, at one view in the Eſſential glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <pb n="502" facs="tcp:102432:264"/> that's the <hi>Roman</hi> plea, and every whit as rational, on behalf of their Saint and Angel-worſhip: They can ſee all the wants of their humble ſupplicants, in <hi>the glaſſe of the Trinity,</hi> as they tell us: They ſay too, that <hi>God reveals to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> to whom Papiſts make their Prayers, <hi>all thoſe things their Devotoes pray to them for;</hi> If the <hi>Socinians</hi> joyn with them, and ſay, <hi>God ſo reveals every thing to Chriſt:</hi> We anſwer them both, that this is to ſet God upon a needleſs work, and indeed to make the <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> in effect, <hi>inferior to his Servants and to his Son:</hi> for thoſe are the greateſt Perſons to whom the <hi>laſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> is made, thoſe inferiour, who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in carrying or preſenting Petitions to another; if then the Supreme God make it his buſineſs to preſent the Supplications of Petitioners to his own Son, he takes upon him that <hi>inferiour Office.</hi> If he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to his Son, that his Son may grant and perform them, it argues a natural Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency in himſelf to anſwer ſuch Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and conſequently a ſuperiority in the Son, whereby he's able to grant and to do for his ſervants what God the Father could not. If the <hi>Socinians</hi> will have us believe, in reſpect of Omnipotence, that Chriſt only repreſents our wants to his Father, and that it's his Fathers Power alone which anſwers and acts for us, it will follow then, that God <hi>has not given him all Power in <pb n="503" facs="tcp:102432:264"/> Heaven, and in Earth,</hi> whoſoever has that Power, can do all things in and of himſelf; if Chriſt cannot do all things <hi>in and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> he has not that Power; if He want that Power, for what reaſon ſhould we pray to him, and not rather immediately to Almighty God? eſpecially ſince
<hi>this Man Chriſt Jeſus died for us, that, in his own blood, he might open to us a new and a living way whereby we might have acceſs with boldneſs to the throne of Grace.</hi> If we may go directly thither, what ſhould we trouble our ſelves with applications to a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Power? as for the Mediatory Office of our Saviour, ſo far as He's concern'd in it, according to <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles, he'l mediate continually for Us, and all Believers in general terms, whether we make any ſupplications to Him or not. The reſult of all then is this, ether Chriſt is not Almighty, nor All-knowing, nor Preſent every where, and conſequently cannot be the
<hi>proper Object</hi> of our Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Prayers, and therefore all ſuch Adorations offered to Him muſt be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Idolatrous, or elſe, our Lord muſt be preſent every where, Know and be able to Do all and every thing, and ſo their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm teaches us in the chapter before quoted, for it ſays, <hi>All Power is given him,</hi> as before, that his Power and Efficacy is great enough to <hi>ſubject all things to himſelf by it,</hi>

<hi>For this cauſe I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and He ſaid unto me, my Grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs;</hi> By <hi>the Lord</hi> here, the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves underſtand <hi>our Lord Jeſus,</hi> and therefore alledge this Text as a proof of Pious Mens praying to Chriſt: Now had Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prayed to Chriſt for Aſſiſtance and Relief in ſuch a caſe, where only the Supreme God could really help him, if <hi>that Chriſt were a meer Creature,</hi> then ſuch a Prayer muſt be Idolatrous, and ſuch Service be called Idolatry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <pb n="528" facs="tcp:102432:277"/> the Creature was rather worſhipped than the Creator; and Chriſt <hi>a Creature</hi> muſt, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> of old, have endeavoured to ſet himſelf up for <hi>a rival God,</hi> and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a <hi>ſeparate Intereſt</hi> of his own, and manage and aſſiſt his ſervants, in a way of <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the
<hi>moſt high God,</hi> and ſo he muſt have Graces of his own, and Strength of his own, to employ for the uſe of his own Devotoes, for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that Chriſt referred him, not to the Grace of God, or to the ſtrength of God, for ſecurity from the violence of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but tells him, <hi>My Grace and my Strength are ſufficient for thee,</hi> therefore there could be no need of applying himſelf to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Now if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were in this caſe guilty of Idolatry, all thoſe who follow the pattern of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> muſt incur the ſame guilt, but he was not guilty, therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were his Imitators guilty of it.</p>

<hi>a Genius,</hi> or <hi>the Sun, or ſome other bright Star,</hi> or an
<hi>Ox,</hi> or any other <hi>Creature.</hi> Such things would have rendred the Goſpel fooliſhneſs with a witneſs, among the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and
<hi>none</hi> would have wondered that Chriſt ſhould have culled out poor
<hi>ignorant Fiſhermen,</hi> and other <hi>illiterate perſons</hi> to be the firſt <pb n="533" facs="tcp:102432:279"/> Preachers, ſince ſuch a ſenceleſs Method of procedure, was only fit for ſuch <hi>dull and unthinking Creatures</hi> to proſecute. But for our comfort, the firſt Chriſtians are free from any ſuch folly; and all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Hereticks, through all ages, have freed them from any ſuch Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They did nothing but what was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Will of God, They took care not to provoke him, whom they knew to be <hi>a conſuming fire,</hi> to jealouſie, by ſetting up a <hi>meer Creature</hi> in competition with him. The Chriſtians in that time, ſhew'd their extreme hatred of Idolatry, in that all the
<hi>allurements</hi> and <hi>terrors</hi> in the world, could not poſſibly draw them to it in other inſtances: If they would but have thrown a little Incenſe into the Fire burning on an Idols Altar; If they would but have made the <hi>ſmalleſt conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion</hi> to ſome admired Heathen Deity, they might have been bleſt both with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity and Rewards: And ſure it could be imputed to nothing but a <hi>ridiculouſly perverſe humour,</hi> to refuſe all kinds of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>Creature-Gods,</hi> meerly becauſe they were <hi>Creatures,</hi> and yet, at the ſame time themſelves to Worſhip or Pray to a Creature of their own ſetting up. We find not but that the <hi>Jews</hi> were more <hi>tractable,</hi> and ſo more
<hi>reaſonable</hi> in the point, when they had once gotten the <hi>guſto of Idolatry</hi> in the Golden Calf, and had the fetters <pb n="534" facs="tcp:102432:280"/> of religious Elders and Governors knock'd off their heels, they ſtood out at nothing, but were ready to worſhip any little Idol, any of their neighbours recommended to them. And other Idolatrous Nations, the <hi>Romans,</hi> in particular, thought it but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that when they had ſet up ſome Gods for themſelves according to their own humours, they ſhould compile all the Divinities they could, and ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if not by the
<hi>quality,</hi> at leaſt by <hi>the multiplicity</hi> of their Gods. But when the <hi>Jews</hi> were once truly purged from their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous humours by ſevere and terrible Judgments, they would never more at their utmoſt peril, admit of the leaſt um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of it: And the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> would have dyed a thouſand deaths, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than have brought ſuch a ſcandal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtianity, as to have retained or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced any thing that might have laid them open to the reproaches of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or have ſeduced or perverted their Brethren. We no where find the Apoſtles or any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick men, ever vindicating that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they offered to our Lord with that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that they went to him only as <hi>

<hi>Roman</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is, or that they might not preſs too rudely upon God, without addreſſing in the firſt place to ſome Favourite ſervant. We never find them arguing, that they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Pray to Chriſt, that He might pray for <pb n="535" facs="tcp:102432:280"/> them,</hi> tho' he always does ſo, as being <hi>the ſole Mediator between God and Man;</hi> nor do they ever defend their Practice by that Allegation, that they do not <hi>terminate their adorations upon Chriſt, but upon his Father,</hi> the contrary would eaſily have been prov'd againſt them from their own Writings: Yet, after all, they were not Idolaters, they did not give that Honour to a <hi>meer Creature</hi> which belonged only to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> therefore that Chriſt, to whom they made their addreſſes, was not a <hi>meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> Yet, as he was Man, He could be no more than a <hi>meer Creature,</hi> therefore He was <hi>more than Man,</hi> therefore <hi>He was God,</hi> the <hi>true and Almighty God</hi> the <hi>great Creator of all things;</hi> and thus have we made good our Argument, that Jeſus Chriſt was
<hi>true God, equal with his Father,</hi> from that, otherwiſe indefenſible, practice of <hi>Worſhipping him,</hi> or <hi>Praying</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately <hi>to him,</hi> as the <hi>Giver of all good Gifts</hi> equally with his Father. If he be own'd to be <hi>the One true God,</hi> we can have no ſcruples, no fears of offending, upon us in Praying to him, and expreſſing all the Signs of <hi>external religious adorations</hi> towards him. If he be not own'd to be <hi>the One true God,</hi> then there's no argument which either a <hi>Socinian</hi> or any Other can bring, to prove the lawfulneſs of <hi>Praying to him as God,</hi> but it will equally ſerve either Papiſts in their praying to Images, Saints or Angels,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:102432:281"/> or Pagans in Praying to their confeſt Idols: and therefore the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſs, with reſpect to thoſe Texts before-cited, where Chriſtians are known by that character of calling on the name of Chriſt.
<q rend="margQuotes">That thoſe Words do ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all that divine Worſhip which is exhibited to Chriſt by his faithful people, that they deſcribe it by that one, the moſt conſiderable part of it, namely, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſtance from him in our Prayers, <hi>Cum neceſſe ſit eum, cujus nomen invoces, pro Deo competente ſenſu colere,</hi> Since it's neceſſary to Worſhip him as God in ſome <hi>fit ſence,</hi> whoſe name you call upon in Prayer:</q> but there is no other
<hi>fit ſence</hi> in which we can call upon him as God, but that which makes him <hi>the true, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God:</hi> Therefore if he may be called upon as God without Idolatry, He muſt be <hi>that true, that eternal God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have at laſt, by God's aſſiſtance, gone through theſe ſeveral heads of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from which we propounded at firſt to prove,
<hi>That Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God was God equal with his Father, or the true, the eternal God:</hi> We have prov'd this from thoſe ſeveral accounts of his Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and his Nature laid down in the Old Teſtament, namely, that it was He who appeared to and convers'd with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> before the fatal deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and that He there bore the name
<hi>Jehovah,</hi> 
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:102432:281"/> the name of God incommunicable to any other: That it was He whoſe Throne the Pſalmiſt declared to be for ever and ever: That it was He who laid the Foundations of the Earth, and that the Heavens were the work of his hands, after whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and periſhing, He yet ſhould continue beyond the reach of time: That Chriſt our Lord ſhould be that Child, that Son, given us in time, on whoſe ſhoulders the Government ſhould be laid; that He ſhould be the wonderful Counſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, and the Prince of Peace: That He ſhould be the Righteous Branch ſpringing up to <hi>David,</hi> whoſe name ſhould be the Lord our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: And finally, that He, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus, ſhould be that Ruler of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſhould be born in <hi>Bethlehem Ephrata,</hi> whoſe goings forth have been of old, from everlaſting. We have proved the ſame aſſertion from thoſe ſeveral Declarations our Saviour has made concerning himſelf, and his Diſciples afterwards concerning him in the New Teſtament, as namely, that of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> of the Angel's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to which the Evangeliſt applies the Prophecy, that our Saviour Incarnate ſhould be called Immanuel, or God with us: That of our Lord joyning himſelf in equal rank with his Father in the Inſtitution of Baptiſm, ordering it to
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:102432:282"/> be performed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: We have proved that our Saviour was that Word which was in the beginning, which was with God, which was God, by whom all things were made viſible and inviſible, in Heaven and upon Earth, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Saviour himſelf, He and his Father were One; that it was He whom Saint
<hi>Thomas,</hi> upon a ſufficient Conviction, declared to be his Lord and his God; that, according to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> He is God over all bleſſed for ever; and that, according to the ſame Apoſtle, He being in the Form of God thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, yet took upon himſelf the Form of a Servant for our ſakes: Theſe proofs I explain'd, enlarged upon, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated them from their Sophiſtry, who would have them look'd upon as proofs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient of the <hi>Divinity of the Son of God.</hi> We prov'd the ſame thing then by thoſe Actions done by himſelf, and in his own Name, during his converſe upon Earth, and done by his Apoſtles in His Name after his Aſcenſion into Heaven: For inſtance, from his paſſing, inſenſibly, through the multitude, who led him to the brow of an Hill, deſigning to caſt him headlong down from thence: From his making the Souldiers, who came with <hi>Judas</hi> to ſeize him, to fall down with barely anſwering <pb n="539" facs="tcp:102432:282"/> them what they deſired, and in the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt ſatisfactory manner: From his commanding
<hi>Lazarous</hi> in his own Name to come forth of his Grave, after four days burying: From his Apprehenſion of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue going out of him to heal the Woman with the bloody Iſſue, tho' only touching the Hem of his Garment: From his calling thoſe that were weary and heavy laden with their ſins, to come to him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing them reſt for their Souls, upon ſo doing: From his Forgiving ſins in an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative manner, his ſearching the Heart, trying the Reins, and, according to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Knowing all things: From his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing and ſending the Holy Ghoſt, and giving it firſt of all with his Breath, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Underſtanding of the Diſciples, and ſending them abroad with a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion equivalent to that which himſelf had received from his Father; and in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from his Diſciples Baptiſing, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doing Miracles, wholly in his Name, and by Faith in him. From this Head we proceeded to prove our Doctrine that Chriſt was God equal with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the Faith of the Primitive Church, where we confin'd our ſelves in our Diſquiſition principally to thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who wrote before the ſtarting of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Controverſie. So, for the
<hi>Greek</hi> Church, we gave you an account of what <pb n="540" facs="tcp:102432:283"/>
               <hi>Clemens</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop in his Epiſtles to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> of what Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Antioch</hi> in his ſeveral Epiſtles, of what <hi>Juſtine Martyr</hi> in his two Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the
<hi>Jew,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his books againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and
<hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and in his <hi>Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> and what <hi>Origen</hi> in his books againſt
<hi>Celſus</hi> furniſhes us with, in evidence of our Saviour's Divine Nature. Then for the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, we gave you the ſence of what
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage, Arnobius,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> have written; from whence we deſcended to Creeds framed, by <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus,</hi> by <hi>Felix</hi> the firſt of that name, Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> by the Firſt and Second Councils at <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſummoned on the account of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> and the Circular Epiſtle of the Latter, from the circular Letters of <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and ſo from the Epiſtle and Creed of the <hi>Nicene</hi> and
<hi>Conſtantinopolitane</hi> general Councils, with the remarkable ſuffrages of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Great, the firſt Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> one much ſuſpected of Arrianiſm himſelf, but a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Writer of Church-Hiſtory. Having done with this, we prov'd laſt of all that no true Divine Worſhip was due to any meer Creature, or could be paid to any ſuch
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:102432:283"/> without Idolatry: That true Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip yet was paid to our bleſſed Lord by his Apoſtles, and firſt Followers, without Idolatry; therefore that our Saviour in conſequence could be no meer Creature: Thus far we had proceeded, and concluded all our works of that nature at an end, and our ſelves at liberty to proſecute our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſcourſe farther.</p>
            <p>But Ill Men, taking advantage of that Liberty now indulged them, a Liberty always fruitful of Errors and Innovations, give us yet more Work, and a neceſſary care to prevent that Poyſon they ſcatter, from ſpreading too far amongſt thoſe who profeſs Chriſtianity in theſe Nations. And here we have <hi>two mighty Pretenders to Piety and Reaſon;</hi> One of which undertakes the Patronage of long exploded <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> the Other of the more refined <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> and both with old Arguments, and it may be, ſome new Fineneſſes attack the <hi>Divinity of our Saviour.</hi> It's no ſmall happineſs that ſuch Men take up ſuch <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> Opinions to maintain, for by that means One is ſomewhat of an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Other, and by theſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between themſelves in ſo weighty a matter, Wiſe and Conſiderate Chriſtians will learn to believe neither of them. As for what our <hi>Socinian</hi> pleads, conſidering
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:102432:284"/> what we aſſerted in the beginning of our Diſcourſe, <hi>viz. That Jeſus Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is the Son of God,</hi> which We, with all ſound Chriſtians underſtood in a
<hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſence;</hi> and that that very Notice inferr'd <hi>a co-eſſentiality of the Son with the Father,</hi> as it does among Men, where the Son is of the ſame Nature with the Father which begets him, we thought we had reaſon; but the <hi>Socinians</hi> have found us out a way of Filiation or Sonſhip, of being <hi>the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,</hi> nay, <hi>the Only begotten Son of God,</hi> without any ſuch Eſſential Relation: thus the
<hi>Racovian</hi> Catechiſm, ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Original of Chriſt's being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or being the Son of God, tells us He is ſo; Firſt,
<q rend="margQuotes">Becauſe He was conceived of the Holy Ghoſt; and being born of a Virgin without the concurrence of a man, he had no other Father but God:</q> and this, <hi>Wiſſowatius</hi> in his note upon that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage tells us, ought to be obſerved, as the firſt reaſon mentioned in Scripture, why Chriſt is the Son of God, in oppoſition to thoſe who found that <hi>relation</hi> upon his <hi>eternal Generation</hi> of his Father. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ſays the Catechiſm,</hi> is the Son of God, becauſe, as He himſelf teaches us,

It's true, Chriſt really is the Son of God, by reaſon of his Conception by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt in the Womb of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: but ſuppoſing, with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt is not a Perſon,</hi> but only the influence of Almighty God, there is not enough
<hi>in that Birth,</hi> ſo miraculous as it is, to give our Saviour the title of the Son of God <hi>diſtinctly and excluſively</hi> of all others. Dr.
<hi>Heylin,</hi> tho' far enough from denying the <hi>eternal Deity of Chriſt,</hi> yet ſeems very willing to reſt in this Reaſon, that He is called the only begotten Son of God, purely upon it, or becauſe He's <hi>the beloved Son, in whom He is well pleaſed,</hi> or his loved Son, or the Son of his Love: and approves of <hi>Maldonat</hi>'s opinion, that <hi>the beloved Son,</hi> and <hi>the only begotten Son,</hi> are terms Reciprocal; but the miſtake is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent: <pb n="545" facs="tcp:102432:285"/> for tho' <hi>Iſaac</hi> be called the <hi>only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of Abraham,</hi> it does not argue that He was the ſole engroſſer of his love, the contrary is apparent from

               <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Man was made <hi>immediately</hi> by the hand of God, no humane faculty concurring at all, and <hi>Adam</hi> is therefore called
<hi>the Son of God</hi> by the Evangeliſt; now there cannot be a Power ſo much greater requir'd, to give a Man a being in the Womb of a Virgin, than to frame him at firſt out of a Piece of Earth, as to make ſo great a diſtance neceſſary, as is between the Firſt and the Second
<hi>Adam:</hi> for Jeſus Chriſt, our Second <hi>Adam,</hi> muſt be the Son of God in ſo peculiar a manner, as muſt make him <hi>infinitely Superiour</hi> to any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he being deſign'd to exerciſe ſuch a Power as no other Creature could poſſibly be capable of. We allow then our Lord's Birth and Conception to have been <hi>one ground</hi> of his being the Son of God, but not <hi>the firſt,</hi> it's no where called ſo in Scripture, nor is it ſufficient to fix him in that ſupereminent ſtation wherein our Faith is fix'd upon him. The ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Filiation is yet much more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, <hi>viz.</hi> his Reſurrection or raiſing from the Womb of the Earth, for we find none called the Son of God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture on that Reaſon; that our Saviour was rais'd from the dead we know, if we
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:102432:287"/> look upon him <hi>as rais'd from the Dead by his own Power,</hi> as indeed He,<note place="margin">

But for ſuch troubleſom paſſages as theſe, I find a remarkable ſaying of
<hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> which ſhews us the whole myſtery of their avoiding the force of plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and it's this, ſpeaking of Chriſt's being called God, he proceeds,
<q rend="margQuotes">When we find it declared in Scripture, not only once or twice, but very often, and very plainly, that God was made Man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that this is a Propoſition abſurd, wholly contrary to right Reaſon, and full of Blaſphemy againſt God, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it muſt be a great deal better to find out ſome <hi>mode of ſpeaking,</hi> according to which one may ſay this concerning God, than to interpret things ſimply and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Letter:</q> that is to ſay, the <hi>Socinians</hi> have reſolved, not to regulate their Opinions by the Scripture, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Scripture to their Opinions: this however is plain dealing, and a ſufficient warning to read their Diſcourſes with the greater Caution, and Intention of mind. But, if the <hi>Socinians</hi> make uſe of this Art by their own Confeſſions in matters of the <hi>cleareſt nature,</hi> and ſo often repeated, we cannot doubt, but they'l rather pitch on <pb n="548" facs="tcp:102432:288"/> ſome <hi>unknown Figure</hi> to elude thoſe Texts which imply our Saviour's
<hi>raiſing himſelf from the Dead,</hi> than own <hi>his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity with his Father in the ſame Eſſence or Nature,</hi> whereby both the aſſertion
<hi>that Chriſt rais'd himſelf, and that He was rais'd by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the dead,</hi> are ſo eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd: But allowing them their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if our Saviour was not rais'd from the Dead by any Power of his Own, but only by that of his Father, and yet, was called the Son of God on account of his Reſurrection, then all thoſe who ſhall riſe from the Dead before that great day, muſt be called <hi>the Sons of God</hi> in the ſame ſence as our Saviour is, and conſequently our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour cannot, on account of ſuch Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, be ſo the Son of God, as to be <hi>his only begotten Son,</hi> excluſively of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, tho' that title be ſo excluſive in it's own nature. As for the three Reaſons of his being called <hi>the Son of God</hi> derived from his Offices; it's true in the firſt place that <hi>God has ſanctifyed our Saviour and ſent him into the World,</hi> but ſo he
<hi>ſanctified Jeremy,</hi> and ſo he <hi>ſanctified John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and the laſt in particular he ſent into the World with an extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>i. e. to Preach the glad tidings of Salvation,</hi> and <hi>to prepare the way of the Lord</hi> againſt his publick appearance, which Employs were both wholly extraordinary: but as for that <hi>deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt <pb n="549" facs="tcp:102432:288"/> upon him,</hi> whereby, ſay they, he was <hi>anointed to his Office,</hi> without meaſure, there was no particularity eminently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Him in that from his own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, upon whom the Spirit deſcended in a <hi>viſible manner,</hi> at the feaſt of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt, and fitted them ſo for the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Preaching, and every way promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Salvation of Mankind. Indeed we no where find the Apoſtles called <hi>the Sons of God;</hi> on account of their being <hi>baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire,</hi> but we ſee our Saviour is declared <hi>the Son of God, in whom he is well pleaſed,</hi> on that occaſion; but he was own'd by the ſame title at his Transfiguration too, when there was no effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there was ſome peculiarly eminent reaſon for giving our Lord this Title, which could not be applied on any account to any other Perſon. If we reflect on the ſecond ground of Chriſt's being called
<hi>the Son of God,</hi> which is, becauſe He is our Great High-Prieſt, and ſo conſtituted by God himſelf; our Author's proof of it is very ſtrange, <hi>viz.</hi> from that paſſage of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi>

               <hi>this day have I begotten thee,</hi> quoted by the Author of the Epiſtle to the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> for tho' thoſe Words are there repeated, as well as in the firſt Chapter of that Epiſtle, yet it's not in a different Sence, or to a new pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but the Apoſtle there, ſpeaking of <pb n="550" facs="tcp:102432:289"/> our Saviour's Prieſthood, and the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellency of that Office</hi> undertaken by him, tells us, <hi>no Man takes this Honour to himſelf, but He that is called of God, as was Aaron:</hi> Now the Apoſtle ſhews that our Saviour had ſuch a Call as well as <hi>Aaron,</hi> for his Father who ſaid to him, <hi>Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee,</hi> ſhewed his Propriety in his Son, and his Love to him by thoſe words, ſo that it could not be ſtrange that his Father ſhould lay ſo great an Honour upon him: But then his title to the Prieſthood it ſelf, is founded on that, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever,</hi>

               <hi>after the order of Melchiſedec,</hi> ſo then, the Son-ſhip of Chriſt is <hi>antecedent</hi> to his Prieſtly Office, and He was made a Prieſt for ever after the order of
<hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec,</hi> becauſe He was the Son of God, and not called the Son of God becauſe He was our High-Prieſt. As for the laſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why our Saviour is called <hi>the Son of God, viz.</hi> Becauſe he is exalted to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power over all things, and ſo is our King,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.5.</note> (which he proves again from the ſame words as quoted in the ſame Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) There yet again the ſame truth occurs, <hi>that Chriſt was the Son of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He entred upon his Kingly Office,</hi> for by Him <hi>God made the worlds,</hi> and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour never had a being, but that at the ſame time he was <hi>the Son of God;</hi> but if God <hi>by Him made the Worlds,</hi>

                  <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</note> as the Apoſtle <pb n="551" facs="tcp:102432:289"/> ſays, and he could not be our King before the Worlds were made, We who are a part of theſe Worlds, being thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures over whom he was to be King; then he was <hi>the Son of God</hi> before he was our King, and therefore could not be his Son on that account. Beſides, if we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all theſe things, the whole grant would be uſeleſs, for Chriſt is called, as before we obſerved, <hi>the only begotten Son of God in an eminent and diſtinguiſhing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> above all others; but if upon account of his Offices Prophetical, Prieſtly, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Chriſt be called the Son of God, then all thoſe who exerciſe the ſame Functions in the world may upon the ſame reaſon lay claim to the ſame title: for of ſome of them we know the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>They are Gods, and they are all the children of the moſt high;</hi> but if they can all juſtly lay claim to the ſame Title, then there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar to our Saviour included in that being the Son, the only begotten Son of God; which yet the very Title it ſelf imports.</p>
            <p>All theſe Reaſons then not being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give our Saviour the Title of <hi>the only begotten Son of God</hi> in a manner ſo
<hi>ſuper-eminent</hi> to all other Creatures and their Originals, particularly to Angels who are of a Spiritual Nature, and are called <hi>the Sons of God:</hi> There muſt remain ſome <pb n="552" facs="tcp:102432:290"/> other ground for our Saviour's being ſo called, and that is <hi>his eternal generation of the Father,</hi> which puts him into ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his Father, as no other creature can poſſibly pretend to. We have prov'd that the whole of his Five Precedent Reaſons do not <hi>fill up the Idea,</hi> or make good the full meaning of thoſe terms, wherein Chriſt is called the only Begotten Son of God, his Beloved Son, or his own Son: for if I am Born of my Mother, but not Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in his own Image, by my reputed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho' my reputed Father were able after Death to raiſe me to Life again, tho' he were able to confer upon me all the Authority in the Univerſe, yet all this will be ſo far from giving Me juſtly the Title of my Father's only-begotten Son, tho' perhaps he never had any other, that by all theſe Reaſons together I ſhould be a <hi>putative Son,</hi> but really no more related to my ſuppoſed Father, than our Saviour was to <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Husband of the bleſſed Virgin, when before her Eſpouſals he was begotten in her by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt.

<hi>diſtinctly and ſeparated from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Spirit,</hi> attributed to him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in Scripture. Now if all theſe Proofs I have laid down before, have proved, that our Saviour had a Being before he was Conceived in the Womb of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, which we think to be proved beyond contradiction, and if our Adverſaries will but allow that Dictate of Common ſence, that, He who really is my Son, is my Son as ſoon as he has a Being, or if He be not my Son then, He never can be my Son o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by Adoption; and ſo Chriſt can never be the <hi>only begotten Son of his Father,</hi> becauſe all thoſe who Believe in and Obey God are his Sons by Adoption too, if they'l but allow this, then Chriſt muſt have been the Son of his Father, before ſuch time as he was Conceived in the Virgins Womb, becauſe he had a Being before that Conception: If Chriſt had a Being before his Conception, it muſt have been as a Spirit, but Spirits do not generate one another, therefore he muſt have had a Being from the beginning of the World. If then we fall in with the <hi>Arrians</hi> and ſay, God <hi>created</hi> his Son the Word firſt <hi>out of nothing,</hi> and then crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all other things by Him, we contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict Scripture, which poſitively aſſures us, that <hi>in ſix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, and all that in them is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſted the ſeventh day,</hi> but God could <pb n="555" facs="tcp:102432:291"/> not reſt the Seventh Day, nor do all he had to do in Six Days if he wrought more than Six Days; but He muſt have worked before the beginning of the Six Days, if he made the Word before he made any thing elſe, and we have the Six Days Work ſumm'd up authentically by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but no account there of the Creation of the Word before the Creation of Matter: If he were not Created before Matter, then he could not Create all things as the
<hi>Arrians</hi> pretend: If therefore He had a Being, it muſt have been from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but he was not Created from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for whatſoever is Created muſt have a Beginning; but he was <hi>begotten of his Father</hi> as the Scriptures aſſure us, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he were Begotten and not Made, and Begotten before the beginnings of the World, He could be Begotten of nothing but of the Subſtance of his Father, there being no other Subſtance for him to be ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated from, and therefore muſt be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, becauſe the Subſtance of his Father is and cannot be otherwiſe than eternal. This being true, it would be meer folly not to fix his <hi>Sonſhip</hi> more peculiarly in this <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation:</hi> for He that is Begotten by a Father, muſt be his Son, and he that is Begotten from eternity, muſt be a Son from eternity, Therefore <hi>Chriſt who was Begotten of his Father from eternity muſt be <pb n="556" facs="tcp:102432:292"/> the Son of his Father from eternity,</hi> which was the thing to be demonſtrated.</p>

<hi>united in a way more intelligible</hi> than our Souls and Bodies? For tho' our Souls are of a Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are <hi>infinitely inferiour</hi> to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Almighty God, and being that Conſtitutive part of Humane Nature, by which Man is a Rational Creature, it might ſeem an eaſie task for us to find out, how that <hi>Soul we reaſon by,</hi> ſhould be united to that <hi>Body we reaſon in:</hi> But ſince we are ſo far to ſeek in this matter, may we not reaſonably conclude, God has hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den this from our Eyes, to moderate and humble our <hi>unruly Fancies,</hi> to keep us from prying into <hi>things that are too high for us,</hi> and to convince us, that many things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <pb n="557" facs="tcp:102432:292"/> we are more immediately concerned, not being a whit the leſs True tho' we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them not, we ought to believe that ſome things may be True with reſpect to God, of which yet we are able to give our ſelves no conſiderable account?

<hi>He and his Father were One, He made not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf God,</hi> their anger againſt him would have very much abated, ſince, in that ſence very Ill Men might have pretended to the Title: but they underſtood, that our Saviour made himſelf <hi>really equal with that One Supreme God</hi> whom they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: and according to their thoughts, his Sanctification and Miſſion into the World by God, if He were his Father, ſet him infinitely above thoſe Figurative Gods, to whom the Father might have communicated ſome Authority or Power, but had neither Sanctified them, nor ſent them with any <pb n="561" facs="tcp:102432:294"/>

            <p>He <hi>exerciſed at that time a prodigious and unaccountable Tyranny over the Bodies <pb n="567" facs="tcp:102432:297"/> of Men;</hi> He could not be content with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving Man's nobler part, but as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo the great enemy of God, would have the whole Man entirely to himſelf: not that it could be any way advantageous to himſelf and his own deſtructive purpoſes, for where he had got the Conqueſt over the Soul before, he knew well enough the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt follow; but he cared not what <hi>impertinent miſchiefs</hi> he ingaged himſelf in, provided he might but the more directly croſs his Maker and his Puniſher: Hence he came to take Poſſeſſion of ſo many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to vent his malice in ſo many tormenting Diſtempers, and eſpecially he invaded thoſe of the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation, as if knowing, by force of antient Prophecies, the World's Saviour was to be born among them, He'd take poſſeſſion entirely of all he could, as if it were by violence to keep out the Lawful Heir from that Inheritance which belong'd to him. It has ſeem'd ſtrange to Many, that whereas a <hi>Corporeal ſuffering</hi> by the ingreſs of the Devil into a Man is ſo very rare now a-days, and was not ſo very frequent among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> even in our Saviour's time; yet ſo many ſhould be
<hi>poſſeſt</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as we find upon record in the Evangeliſts: This has made divers believe, that all <hi>violent or convulſive diſtempers</hi> were generally taken to be the effects of the influence of ſome <pb n="568" facs="tcp:102432:298"/> malignant Spirits; not as if there had really been any Devil within them, but, at moſt, as if he had been permitted then, as he was in <hi>Job</hi>'s caſe, to inflict bodily diſeaſes upon ſome <hi>by external cauſes,</hi> and not otherwiſe; We know well enough that the Devil, in ſome ſence, may be called the author of all thoſe Diſtempers Men's Bodies at this time labour under, for it was
<hi>Sin that introduced Death</hi> and all the Preliminaries to it, and the Devil introduced Sin: But to reſolve all theſe Poſeſſions by the Devil, recorded by the Evangeliſts, into nothing but ſome <hi>more violent or unuſual diſeaſes than ordinary,</hi> can no way be allowed; For we find it not ſaid of thoſe that were Lepers, that were Lame, or Blind, or that had bloody Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, or that had Feavers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they were poſſeſt, yet thoſe diſtempers were of very malignant Natures frequently, and inſuperable by all the Art of the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, as the Goſpel-Hiſtory informs us: But among other inſtances of thoſe poſſeſt with Devils, we find <hi>Two coming out of the tombes, exceeding fierce and dangerous, ſo that no Man might paſs that way,</hi> and it was
<hi>the voice of a Devil,</hi> not of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Man, who would have been glad of a releaſe from Slavery, that cryed out, <hi>What have we to do with thee, Jeſus thou Son of God?</hi>

<hi>providential guard</hi> about them ſtill, which check'd the malicious deſigns of Hell, and made thoſe poor creatures, tho' <hi>ſo terrible to others,</hi> yet not <hi>to ſink by themſelves</hi> into Deſpair: thoſe ſtrange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of an <hi>unuſual vigor,</hi> apparent in the Perſons Poſſeſt, ſhewed the World plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how ſtrong the curſed Inmate was, how little Natural ſtrength was able to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, and how Dreadful the Prince of Darkneſs muſt have been to all, had not <pb n="575" facs="tcp:102432:301"/> ſtrong and weighty chains been laid upon him.

Had he indeed gone about to <hi>ſeduce them</hi> from the Service of the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> and
<hi>Jacob,</hi> they might juſtly have exclaim'd againſt him: but he referr'd all the glory of what he did to the ſame God, and appeal'd to him as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore they could not, upon any juſt reaſon, condemn him as acting by <hi>any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful ways,</hi> while they admired their <hi>own Children</hi> for thoſe very things, for which they pretended to condemn
<hi>Him.</hi> From this he proceeds to a farther Argument in his own vindication: The Devil indeed is ſtrong <pb n="581" facs="tcp:102432:304"/> and powerful, and where he gets poſſeſſion is very Hardly removed; If he pretends on foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Exorciſms, to quit his hold, it's but to delude the Ignorant and Credulous, and to return at his own pleaſure; if he be not for that illuſion, He cannot be ſtronger than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, therefore He cannot caſt out Himſelf; but the Devil is really and frequently caſt out, and that ſo, as not to be able to return to his former Manſion when he pleaſes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt be caſt out by one <hi>really ſtronger</hi> than himſelf; but there is no Being more Powerful than <hi>the Prince of Darkneſs,</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another Reaſon of our Saviour's coming into the World, was, <hi>That the World might be convinced that the Law given by</hi> Moſes <hi>to the Jewiſh Nation, was really the Law of God, and that it could not therefore be repeal'd by any Power or Authority whatſoever, but his who was God.</hi> The <hi>laſt</hi> part of this Reaſon is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence upon the <hi>firſt;</hi> for in all Countries the ſanction and repealing of Laws require one and the ſame Authority at leaſt; nay, where it's poſſible, the <hi>annulling</hi> of a Law requires much the <hi>greater Power;</hi> thus <pb n="596" facs="tcp:102432:312"/> among the
<hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Edictum Praetoris,</hi> or the Praetor's Edict, had the force of a Law, and Obedience was abſolutely required to it, only it might be reſcinded by a <hi>Reſcript</hi> of the Emperour, whoſe Power was indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both over the Praetor and his Law; but the Praetor could not repeal an <hi>Imperial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript,</hi> nor his own <hi>Edict,</hi> after an <hi>Imperial Confirmation:</hi> thus God can vacate all <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws,</hi> when and where he pleaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he's ſuperiour to all Laws but thoſe flowing from his own Nature; but it's a <hi>damning Sin</hi> for Man to go about to vacate God's Laws, becauſe Man, in his higheſt ſtate has no other Authority but what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from God, who cannot be ſuppoſed to give any Man an Authority contradictory to his own, or that ſhould interfere with it; but among Men, as in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it required an <hi>Imperial Power</hi> to repeal an <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Sanction;</hi> ſo among our ſelves, an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> can be repealed only by an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> the King in Parliament being in all reſpects whatſoever, the <hi>ſupreme Power</hi> of the Nation. Thus we ſee the Paralleliſm between both the making and diſannulling both Divine and Humane Laws; ſo that it appears altogether rational, that the <hi>Moſaic Law,</hi> if <hi>originated from God,</hi> ſhould be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by God.</hi> As for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that it was <hi>given by God, and only by him,</hi> he that reads the Scripture, and owns that to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <pb n="597" facs="tcp:102432:312"/> and the Jews to this day are ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs'd with that Aſſurance, that all the World knows the vacating that by One, who appear'd but a <hi>mean Man,</hi> is one great prejudice the Jews make uſe of at this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtianity; they are certain God gave their Law and every part of it, they are as certain that the ſame God only could change or take it away, they conclude, as our <hi>Socinians</hi> do, That <hi>Jeſus was a meer Man and no God,</hi> therefore they look upon him as <hi>very wicked</hi> for pretending to put an end to that Law. Now, if we wanted the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to confirm us in that Knowledge, a bare Reflection upon the behaviour of the Jewiſh Nation at all times is enough to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, that <hi>God was the Author of their Law.</hi> For if we look upon them as eſteem'd by their Neighbours, they were never lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the verieſt Fools and Ignorants in the Univerſe, that
<hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who procur'd the Tranſlation of the Old Teſtament into Greek, thought the Books of their Law worth procuring at a vaſt expence, ſo he and ſeveral adjacent Nations at all times were ready to enter into
<hi>terms of Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But were they never ſo wiſe or knowing in any thing, they never found any reaſon to ſhake off the Yoke of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> they own'd it upon all occaſions, and, as at firſt, when they fell under any <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Affliction,</hi> they had immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony;</hi> from <pb n="598" facs="tcp:102432:313"/> whence they re-confirm'd their Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>the true God, the God of their fathers,</hi> and apply'd themſelves to Him; ſo afterwards, they employ'd themſelves earneſtly in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating that Law from any <hi>Aſperſions</hi> which their Enemies might lay upon it, and in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to procure Proſelytes to that Law, from among the <hi>neighbouring Nations.</hi> But now we muſt have a very mean opinion of the Jews, if we can imagine a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould ſubmit themſelves to <hi>a body of Laws,</hi> for a courſe of ſeveral ages; that they ſhould believe it their indiſpenſible du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to obey all the particular Injunctions of a Law that was extreamly nice and difficult to be obſerv'd; ſuch a Law as, in its Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial part, was very troubleſome and heavy, yet neceſſary enough, conſidering the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the People it was given to, and the great end and aim of it; that they ſhould own the <hi>obliging force</hi> of this Law, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe many Rebellions againſt it which they were guilty of, and which there ſtood upon record againſt them, to their perpetual Reproach and Shame; that they ſhould be infinitely nice in preſerving the <hi>Copies of their Law pure and uncorrupt,</hi> tho' it contained ſo many Prophecies and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt them, and the accounts of ſo many Terrible Judgments executed againſt them for their Stubbornneſs, Diſobedience and Incorrigibility, and that, after all, they ſhould expoſe their lives to Tortures and to
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:102432:313"/> Death it ſelf for the ſake of theſe very Laws, rather than by any force be drawn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce or to treſpaſs upon an ordinary Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of them; we muſt have a very mean opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Jews, if we can believe they would do and ſuffer all theſe things for the ſake of ſuch a Law, whoſe Original they really were unacquainted with, or
<hi>they</hi> could be perſuaded to aſſert its coming in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the hand of God himſelf, when there were ſo many in all parts of the World, who becauſe they would not admit of it, were engaged by their proper Intereſts, and for their own credit, to ruine its reputation, if they were not able to prove beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that their Law had its Original from God himſelf. Now ſince ſo little has appear'd againſt the
<hi>Divine Original</hi> of the Jewiſh Law, in any age, and that little has been ſo very eaſily baffled, we can the leſs wonder that the ſcatter'd Poſterity of the Jews to this day ſhould be ſo hardly perſuaded to quit that Law. Since they have <hi>unanſwerable Reaſons</hi> to believe that as it did <hi>proceed</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>from God,</hi> ſo it could be
<hi>abrogated</hi> by none but <hi>the ſame God,</hi> therefore thoſe who go about to perſuade the World, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Meſſiah was not God,</hi> but a <hi>meer Man,</hi> and ſo confirm <hi>their</hi> old Prejudices taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Saviour during his converſe upon earth; ſuch lay a deſperate <hi>ſtumbling-Block</hi> in the way of the Converſion of thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable People; for our <hi>great Intereſt</hi> is againſt <pb n="600" facs="tcp:102432:314"/> them to prove that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was God,</hi> for, that being granted, they'll eaſily yield, that <hi>He was the Meſſias,</hi> and that he lawfully might abrogate the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> in part or in the whole, as He himſelf thought good.</p>
            <p>When we ſpeak thus of the <hi>Abrogation of the Moſaic Law,</hi> it's to be obſerv'd, that part of what's compriſed in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> ſo not <hi>His</hi> by any peculiar Title, and therefore, though <hi>in his Books,</hi> not repealable, ſome part of his Laws were Political, which, ſince the Fall of the Jewiſh State and their penal Diſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are <hi>impracticable,</hi> and conſequently <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated of themſelves;</hi> thoſe Laws therefore which we at this time more particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, are thoſe called
<hi>Ceremonial Laws,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated wholly to the Jewiſh Nation in diſtinction from all others, and made Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic by the Authoritative Sanction of God himſelf; this was that Law, which as it had a particular reſpect unto the Coming of the Meſſias, being full of Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, repreſenting what <hi>He was to do and ſuffer,</hi> ſo it could rationally be no more than Temporal, and expire of courſe at ſuch time as the Meſſias the Anti-type ſhould appear in the World: and ſince the Meſſias, when come, would be able to effect all thoſe things for Men, which thoſe Types and Shadows did but point at, the Jews themſelves could not but be glad to have that Burthen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved <pb n="601" facs="tcp:102432:314"/> which
<hi>neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear,</hi> when that

<hi>Church of God</hi> exiſtent in the World before the time of
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s receiving a Law from Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> We cannot deny but that the <hi>Roman</hi> part of the Chriſtian World is as much, nay infinitely more, clogg'd with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies than that of the Jews ever was, though <pb n="611" facs="tcp:102432:319"/> we take in the <hi>traditional part of Jewiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> which had no foundation in what was delivered by

               <q rend="margQuotes">It is partly becauſe the great exceſs and multitude of them had ſo encreas'd in theſe latter days, that the burden of them was intolerable, whereof St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that they were grown to ſuch a multitude, that the eſtate of Chriſtian People was in worſe caſe, concerning that matter, than were the Jews, and therefore he adviſed the taking away that burden as there was opportunity: but if he complain'd then, much more would he have done ſo had he ſeen the number of thoſe in uſe at the time of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to which the Multitude he had ſeen was nothing to be compared: which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Ceremonies was ſo great, and many of them ſo dark, that they did more confound and darken, than declare and ſet forth Chriſt's Benefits to us.</q> This Perſuaſion was ſo rationally ſettled in the minds of

Indeed under the

<hi>Adam,</hi> or any of the <hi>Antediluvian Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi> or for
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity, till the Redemption out of
<hi>Aegyt,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Sacrifices without ſomewhat of Ceremony, yet neither <hi>the ſame</hi> nor <hi>the ſame number</hi> were required of them, as were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards enjoined the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and yet we cannot deny but the Church of God was as <hi>inwardly glorious,</hi> and their <hi>Services as really acceptable</hi> to Almighty
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:102432:320"/> God, as the Jewiſh Service was, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with all thoſe <hi>beautiful Circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had appointed. But now if the Church had a Being in the World, and a Well-being too, before the Moſaic Service was determined, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows plainly, that
<hi>thoſe Ceremonies</hi> enjoined by <hi>Moſes,</hi> though directed by God himſelf in every particular, were <hi>not eſſential to, nor inſeparable from</hi> the Church of God. Nay that <hi>very great Ceremony of Circumciſion,</hi> though it began as high as <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, that particular <hi>Friend of God,</hi> was <hi>no way eſſential to</hi> the Church, and therefore not laid on <hi>Noah,</hi> not uſed by
<hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> nor known by the Saints of the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> World. Beſides, ſuppoſing the Patriarchs had had a <hi>whole ſett of Ceremonies,</hi> and thoſe Typical as thoſe of the Jews afterwards were, yet we may certainly conclude, that they were not the ſame with thoſe the Jews had, for then that Exactneſs required of <hi>Moſes</hi> in every punctilio, and by <hi>Moſes</hi> requir'd of the Levitical Prieſts, would have been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, for that Method of ſerving God, which Men are brought up to is eaſie and ſtrongly enough retain'd by them, without any ſuch

               <hi>his being without Sin,</hi> it depended on the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Mortal to an Immortal Being: the very nature of which ſuperiour Being was more effectual than the Refiner's Fire on Gold or Silver, purifying that otherwiſe <hi>corrupt Body</hi> it was united to, and fortifying it againſt all that proclivity to Sin and eaſie ſuccumbency to Temptation which the reſt of Mankind was obnoxious to. Nor was it any thing, but ſuch a <hi>coacting Omnipotence,</hi> which could poſſibly have produc'd <hi>a clean thing out of an unclean,</hi> or a Body without Sin out of that which was naturally ſinful. There is certainly ſuch a ſtate as that of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happineſs,</hi> but it is attainable only as the reward of Merit in a proper ſenſe, or, as we ordinarily ſay, it's <hi>as Wages, which he who faithfully performs his work deſerves,</hi> and may juſtly lay claim to as his own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be deny'd without Injuſtice; as for inſtance, whereas the condition of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life is, <hi>This do and live,</hi> whoſoever it is that performs the Condition, and does what's requir'd, he has for ſo doing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided there be no circumſtantial failure in the performance of the work, a juſt and rightful claim to that eternal Life propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and God himſelf could not be juſt, ſhould he deny the propos'd reward to ſuch a One as ſhould compleatly perform the Condition ſet before him.

<hi>infinitely Good and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> yet his Juſtice muſt as certainly be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the puniſhment of Criminals, who are obſtinate in their Crimes, as his Mercy in pardoning Criminals, who are truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of that Guilt they lye under: Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Sons of Men there are none who are not great Sinners, therefore they are all properly the objects of God's Juſtice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Juſtice can never be at reſt till thoſe who are Sinners are puniſh'd; therefore that muſt be true, that that <hi>Mercy</hi> is as <hi>infinite</hi> which pardons one Criminal who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment, as that Juſtice is which condignly puniſhes all Delinquents, and this ſtands good, let the Pardon be granted on what conſiderations ſoever: for, for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to puniſh</hi> the guilty is but

<hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neceſſary,</hi> ſince Mercy ſhews it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in giving all things their Being, in providing every thing neceſſary for them, in giving them Rules and Laws of all kinds to act by, and all poſſible Encouragements for them to manage themſelves by thoſe <pb n="645" facs="tcp:102432:336"/> Rules, and all this when there was no Merit on the ſide of the Creature to oblige him to it, and that God, being infinitely happy in himſelf, had no need either of their Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence or their Services, therefore the very Being of all things is only the effect of his eternal Will, as the four and twenty Elders acknowledge in their Euchariſtic Hymns to God,

<pb n="649" facs="tcp:102432:338"/> be no other than their want of Merit, for had they had any <hi>inherent Merits</hi> of their own to plead, the ſame infinite Juſtice which was concern'd <hi>to puniſh their Sins,</hi> was equally concern'd <hi>to reward their Merits;</hi> but if the want of Merit hinder'd their procuring their own Reconciliation, there muſt have been ſome Merit in Chriſt which was able to effect it, and that Merit muſt have been exhibited on our account, and that Merit, ſupplying the Sinners defect, muſt have been ſatisfactory to divine Juſtice, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt have fallen upon Sinners, while they had no better deſerving to plead on their own accounts; but if God reconcile the World to himſelf in Chriſt, and Chriſt be <hi>One eternal God,</hi> co-eſſential with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what's done by One is done by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo, though the Son merited at his Father's hand the Sinner's pardon, yet the Sinner is <hi>freely</hi> forgiven of God, the Son <hi>freely</hi> interpoſing between him and Divine Juſtice, and <hi>freely</hi> concurring in the ſame Pardon of his Treſpaſſes.

Now, the Puniſhment of Sins being the effect of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the Remiſſion of them the effect <pb n="651" facs="tcp:102432:339"/> of Mercy, this <hi>Redemption-Price</hi> paid down ſatisfied Juſtice and made way for Mercy, and therefore <hi>that Price</hi> ſo paid down was <hi>meritorious,</hi> and <hi>meritorious for us,</hi> who had no Merits of our own; therefore this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was really
<hi>free</hi> with reſpect to us, howſoever God the Son ſatisfied his Father's Juſtice to procure that Remiſſion for us. The laſt proof the
<hi>Socinians</hi> alledge, is, that Parable of our Saviour's, <hi>Matth.</hi>
18.23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The great buſineſs of our Saviour in that Parable, is, to urge Men to mutual Charity and Forgiveneſs of one another, in caſe of any Treſpaſſes by one committed againſt the other, this he urges from the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of that Remiſſion which is made to us, and the <hi>Smalneſs</hi> of the greateſt Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes which can be committed againſt us, in compariſon of thoſe Treſpaſſes we are guilty of againſt God; ſo the Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this, <hi>If God forgive us our ten thouſand Talents, a debt which we are utterly uncapable of ever diſcharging, we ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our offending Brethren thoſe hundred pence, which it's poſſible they may be engaged in to us,</hi> or thoſe little inconſiderable Injuries, they may have done us, and for which, on occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they may be capable of making us a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Compenſation. If it be urged, that <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> which we partake of is
<hi>free,</hi> we own it, for it proceeds from <hi>one God,</hi> without any other Motive but what proceeds from himſelf; but the Father, and the Son, and

<hi>Neceſſities</hi> of thoſe it was given for. But further, we are to conſider, that the Eternity of that Death <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin had laid him open to, did not proceed from the nature of the Sin it ſelf, for <hi>no Crime infinite in its own Nature can proceed from a finite Being;</hi> but the Eternity of that <pb n="662" facs="tcp:102432:345"/> Penalty annex'd to Sin in Man ariſes from the <hi>abſolute Infinity</hi> of that God againſt whom he ſinn'd, and whoſe Anger when irreverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble muſt be eternal, from a reſpect to that <hi>infinite Goodneſs and Juſtice,</hi> eſſential to him, whereby he had conferred ſuch <hi>mighty Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> upon Man, and laid ſo very

But now let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God <hi>condeſcending to take upon him our Nature,</hi> that very
<hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> alone is of infinite weight; we look upon it as a very meritorious piece of Humility, for a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince to take upon him the Habit of a Beggar, only to procure good for ſome miſerable undeſerving Wretches; the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> therefore long celebrated the glorious Memory of their laſt Monarch <hi>Codrus,</hi> who put on the ignoble Arms of a private Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, meerly that he might die by the hands of thoſe Enemies, who had been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd by an Oracle not to kill him, by which private Habit aſſum'd, he procur'd the ſafety of his Country; but we never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire much the Humility or Condeſcenſion of <pb n="664" facs="tcp:102432:346"/> that Beggar, who wears <hi>Rags,</hi> becauſe he has no <hi>richer Habits</hi> to put on. Now, had the Son of God taken upon him a Royal Grandeur, had he been wrapt in purple, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd by all Mankind in his Cradle, worn the Imperial Crown even in his Infancy, or had he taken any other Methods we could fancy to our ſelves, which might have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him conſiderable to the World, yet this had been an infinitely greater Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; than for a
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> or an <hi>Alexander,</hi> or a <hi>Trajan,</hi> or a
<hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or a <hi>Tamerlane</hi> to have taken upon him the Perſon of the moſt contemptible Wretch in the World, and for the nobleſt End. It cannot well be queſtioned, whether it was poſſible for God to take into his Own an Humane Nature or not? Humanity it ſelf being the product of his own Eternal Power, was, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Creation, wholly at his command; and though <hi>God's aſſuming a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> might be ſuppos'd enough of it ſelf to render that Body immortal, yet we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be aſſured, that he could make it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own good Pleaſure,
<hi>liable to Death,</hi> as well as other Humane Bodies were; but the Union between the Divine and Humane Nature being ſo cloſe and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, the Humane Nature, howſoever <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Mortality,</hi> muſt contract an infinite <hi>Honour and Dignity</hi> from thence; but after all, the Condeſcenſion is not a whit the leſs, that he who <hi>is God</hi> ſhould aſſume that <hi>mortal <pb n="665" facs="tcp:102432:346"/> Nature,</hi> nor is his Love leſs admirable who ſhould aſſume it for our ſake, or who ſhould ſtoop ſo low purely to make up that breach that was between his Father and Mankind; but if to this Condeſcenſion we add a due conſideration of thoſe many Calamities or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Sufferings this Humane Nature was all along obnoxious to, if we conſider the <hi>Son of God, as he was Man,</hi> always in a ſtate of Perſecution, and that carried on by various Degrees to the utmoſt Extremity, and then recollect again that Honour it had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that cloſe and inſeparable Union there was between the Divine and Humane Nature in Chriſt; <hi>ſuch Sufferings</hi> in
<hi>ſuch a Perſon,</hi> muſt be acknowledg'd <hi>infinitely meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,</hi> and conſequently capable of atoning or ſatisfying for infinite Guilt, though ſuch Sufferings were not Eternal, as thoſe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men are or ought to have been; for it's not neceſſary that the
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> given for Humane Sins ſhould be of the ſame kind, as if Divine Anger could have been averted by no Method but that of the <hi>Lex talio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> or like for like, but that the <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Price,</hi> paid for the guilty Priſoner, ſhould be of equal value to thoſe Injuries done by that Priſoner to him, to whom that <hi>Redemption-Price</hi> is paid down; as if I take up Goods or Silver Coin of any one, for which I my ſelf am wholly inſolvent, and another undertakes for me to diſcharge the Debt, the Creditor will ſcarce take it ill, if <pb n="666" facs="tcp:102432:347"/> he paid to the full in Gold or Jewels for that Silver or thoſe Goods he had given credit for, though the Debt be not paid in kind.</p>

<hi>generous</hi> of all would be willing to underſtand the nature of that Obligation they have to be ſo grateful, and the reaſons of it. We are then obliged by God's <hi>free pardoning</hi> of our Sins; how do we know he has done ſo? By the Teſtimony of Scripture, that <hi>Word of God,</hi> which is ſufficient to inſtruct us to Eternal Life: Well, we own Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture does inform us, <hi>That our Sins are freely pardoned by God,</hi> and we ſhould build very confidently on that evidence, did not thoſe we have to do with teach us a great deal of Diffidence, and ſhow us that ſuch Paſſages of Scripture are capable of very different Interpretations, and that when we think we have a very clear proof of this or <pb n="675" facs="tcp:102432:354"/> another Particular, when we come to ſcan things accurately by our own Reaſon, we find we have none at all; for the ſame Scripture which tells us we are
<hi>freely pardoned,</hi> tells us as plainly, and as intelligibly, <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is that Lamb of God who takes away the Sins of the World; that Chriſt died for us,</hi> or for our Sins; <hi>that he bore our Sins, and carried our Tranſgreſſions;</hi> that <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us with his own moſt precious Blood;</hi> that <hi>he gave his Soul a Redemption-Price for many;</hi> that <hi>he's our Mediator;</hi> that <hi>he has reconciled us to God,</hi> and is <hi>a Propitiation for our Sins;</hi> and that the Scripture has very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſtated the Compariſon between Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal expiatory Sacrifices and the Sacrifice of Chriſt, the former being only ſo many Types and Shadows, the latter the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, or the thing ſo long and ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by them: And yet, according to
<hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine, we muſt not believe one word of all this, but we muſt fly to <hi>fooliſh Gloſſes</hi> and <hi>impertinent Figures</hi> to elude the force of all theſe Aſſertions; and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture muſt be made a Noſe of Wax, that it may the better be ſubſervient to the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous prejudices of pretended Rationaliſts. But if we may ſo ſlightly paſs over theſe Aſſertions, we may as ſlightly paſs the reſt, and deny that we ow any Gratitude to God on account of the <hi>forgiveneſs of our Sins;</hi> according to true Catholick Principles we believe, both that our Saviour has <hi>ſatisfied</hi> 
               <pb n="676" facs="tcp:102432:355"/> for our Sins, and that our God has <hi>freely forgiven</hi> them: and none but a <hi>Socinian</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner would find any difficulty to reconcile thoſe Truths to one another, as we have ſhewn before. But we'll ſuppoſe Gratitude to Heaven for Mercies receiv'd, eſpecially that of Salvation by Chriſt, would oblige us ſufficiently to <hi>Holineſs of Life;</hi> it will follow from thence, that that Doctrine which ſets off the Love and Mercy of God and Chriſt to the greateſt advantage, muſt needs offer the moſt conſiderable Motives for our Obedience; but here a new Vindicator of <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> acknowledges,<note place="margin">Defence of the Hiſt. of <hi>

Now, if Faith be ſo neceſſary a Condition, that without it the Sins of none can be pardon'd, then <hi>infinite Mercy</hi> cannot imply a <hi>neceſſity of pardoning every Sin;</hi> and if
<hi>that</hi> Condition of <hi>believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> be requiſite, I know not why
<hi>another</hi> Condition, ſuch as a <hi>Chriſt offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Sacrifice to atone his Father's diſpleaſure for Mens ſins,</hi> ſhould not be ſo too: As for <hi>infinite Juſtice,</hi> we believe it neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a <hi>Puniſhment for every Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and therefore we believe, that had not our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our undergone that Puniſhment for our ſins which was due to us, every Sin of ours muſt have been inevitably puniſh'd; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas we conclude, agreeably to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that the greateſt part of Mankind are eternally damn'd, we conclude their Damnation is the effect of <hi>infinite Juſtice,</hi> and that they have no more than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; and whereas <hi>all thoſe who believe</hi> in Chriſt have their Sins pardoned, and are eternally ſaved, we believe <hi>that</hi> the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <pb n="685" facs="tcp:102432:360"/> of the ſame <hi>infinite Juſtice;</hi> for ſince Chriſt has <hi>really ſatisfied for our Sins,</hi> and his Father has accepted it for us, and the Will of God the Father and of God the Son, being eternally the ſame; ſo that the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and the Acceptance were of eternal Determination; God could not evidence <hi>that Juſtice</hi> to us, but by making good that Original Contract or Agreement, and ſo by beſtowing Pardon and eternal Happineſs on all <hi>thoſe who believe in his Son;</hi> and the <hi>ſame Juſtice</hi> is as much evidenc'd in the <hi>condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Wicked,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> offer'd by Chriſt being ſufficient to atone for all Sins, upon condition that all Sinners believe in him who has ſo ſatisfied, that ſleight put upon the Condition, or the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of the greater part of Mankind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them juſtly to
<hi>Divine Vengeance,</hi> as even common Reaſon teaches us. The
<hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> tell us, as if they were the Privadoes of Heaven, that God's Mercy and Juſtice are both moderated by his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, as if they needed ſomewhat of <hi>Limitation or Reſtraint:</hi> but why ſhould Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Mercy be moderated or governed by Wiſdom and Goodneſs, more than Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Goodneſs ſhould be managed by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or Mercy? God's Attributes do not <hi>ſuperintend</hi> one another, but they are all <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> concentred in one infinite Being, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>all equal,</hi> and no more capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering one with another, than God can <pb n="686" facs="tcp:102432:361"/> be ſuppoſed capable of diſagreeing with himſelf; and whereas we are taught by thoſe Men of Reaſon, that <hi>that Juſtice which is exerciſed in puniſhing Sinners, is called in Scripture God's Severity, his Anger, and his Fury;</hi> if we allow it, will they ſay,
<hi>that Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in God, or Anger, or Fury, are unjuſt?</hi> We know thoſe words are generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in an ill ſenſe; Severity, among Men, can admit of no more favourable Character than that of <hi>Summum Jus,</hi> or extremity of Law, which is thought to be <hi>Summa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria,</hi> or extremity of Injuſtice; and Anger and Fury, in Men, are generally taken for <hi>vicious Exceſſes,</hi> and ſuch, as till a Man can govern or conquer, he's not look'd upon as any extraordinary proficient in Vertue; but we hope there are no ſuch <hi>vicious Exceſſes</hi> in God, therefore ſuch words are made uſe of only according to Mens Capacities, to ſhew us how very angry God is with Sin and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, (and yet no more than Juſtice, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence with Mercy, will allow) and to ſtrike a juſt Aw and Terror upon Men; then they who will avoid breaking ſuch or ſuch a Law, out of Fear of the Indignation of the Law-giver, whoſe ſuperiour Power and Authority may render him formidable, may much more be afraid of breaking the Laws of that God, whoſe Anger is irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and whoſe Juſtice is inevitable: and though there be neither Juſtice nor Mercy in <hi>puniſhing</hi> the Innocent, or in acquitting <pb n="687" facs="tcp:102432:361"/> the Guilty, yet there is no treſpaſs upon either, in <hi>pardoning</hi> the Guilty, when the Innocent Freely and Voluntarily takes that Guilt upon himſelf, eſpecially when the Quality of that Innocent, ſo offering himſelf, is ſuch, that the
<hi>ſame degree of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> or <hi>Puniſhment as heavy</hi> falling upon him, cannot poſſibly bring eternal Ruines upon <hi>Him,</hi> as it would upon <hi>inferiour Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> as we often ſee among

<hi>Died for us,</hi> that <hi>He laid down his Life for Sinners, &amp;c.</hi> they allow no more to be ſignified by it than this, <hi>That Chriſt was a Sacrifice for us, in the ſame manner as former Sacrifices were for thoſe who offered them; ſo that as thoſe Sacrifices were never look'd upon as any Compenſation for the Sins of the Offerers, neither could that of Chriſt be a Compenſation for theirs for whom he offered himſelf; only his Offering Himſelf ſo ſeems like the others, as a certain Condition on which Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be granted;</hi> But if common Senſe may be our Guide, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference muſt be very great between this of Chriſt and all former Sacrifices offer'd by the Jews, as generally the <hi>Antitype</hi> is accounted of a ſuperiour Nature to the <hi>Type:</hi> for tho'
<hi>Remiſſion of Sins</hi> were granted to the Offerer upon his Sacrifice being offer'd, yet it was not upon account of that Sacrifice offered, but upon account of the <hi>Sincerity and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Offerer,</hi> and that reſpect his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice had to the Death of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> yet
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:102432:362"/> to come; for, though Beaſts were innocent, there was nothing meritorious in their being ſacrificed, their Sufferings being involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and themſelves in a corrupt and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate; becauſe there was nothing in the ancient Holocauſts conſiderable but their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> therefore they were offer'd

<hi>ſtood daily miniſtring and offering the ſame Sacrifices which can never take away ſin; but this Man, after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſin, for ever ſat down on the right-hand of God,</hi> nor did he need to offer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener, for <hi>by one Offering he has perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> The Difference then between the Sacrifice of our Saviour and thoſe of the Law is notorious; but now, if Remiſſion of Sins could be granted to the Offerer of a <hi>Legal Sacrifice,</hi> and yet a <hi>Legal Sacrifice</hi> could not take away the Sins of the Offerers; and if the
<hi>ſingle Sacrifice of Chriſt</hi> did really take away Sins, both which things are aſſerted in the Texts now cited; then a great deal more muſt be meant, by <hi>Chriſt's Sacrifice taking away ſin,</hi> than the bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins amounts to; It muſt ſignifie <hi>taking away that Guilt of ſin,</hi> by which Men are render'd obnoxious to Puniſhment: which, conſidering that Juſtice inherent in Almighty God, cannot be removed but by ſubſtituting ſomewhat ſo innocent in the Sinner's room, that the Sufferings of that Innocent may ſatisfie for the Impunity
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:102432:364"/> of the Sinner; but it being inconſiſtent with Juſtice to puniſh the Innocent for the Sinner, if the Innocent be
<hi>unwilling,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his Innocence as his Security from Puniſhment; therefore our Saviour, for the acquittal of Divine Juſtice, offer'd himſelf <hi>voluntarily</hi> to die for us, and that when no Power on Earth could have taken away his Life from him; which Offer of his being the effect of his eternal Will, and his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Will <hi>the ſame</hi> with that of his Father.

<hi>thoſe Sufferings</hi> (though to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone in time) as really, and in their own intrinſic Nature, equivalent to thoſe Puniſhments otherwiſe due to a ſinful World. Upon the whole, <hi>Chriſt died for, or in the room of Sinners,</hi> not to prevent their temporal but their eternal Death; and by his Humiliation and his Death, who was ſo Innocent and ſo Great, gave eternal Juſtice as abſolute Satisfaction as the eternal Puniſhment of all thoſe who are now ſaved through <hi>Him</hi> would have done, and therefore when <hi>Socinians</hi> ſeek for a reaſon, for their denying <hi>Chriſt's Death to have been in our ſtead,</hi> and fly to that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

<hi>Redeemers,</hi> yet ſo long as there is no Paralleliſm between the Circumſtances of thoſe Redemptions <hi>they</hi> have wrought, and the Circumſtances of Chriſt's, we muſt of neceſſity conclude, that Scripture means a great deal more by naming Chriſt a Redeemer, than by giving
<hi>Moſes</hi> or any other eminent Perſon the ſame Character; that Name is <hi>figurative</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to all others, it is proper as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Chriſt; we may illuſtrate the Caſe by ſuch an Inſtance as this, A Soveraign Prince, bleſt with One onely and infinitely beloved Son, having in his power a Capital Offender againſt his Laws, in concert with that Son, determines that ſuch Puniſhment as is proportionable to his Crimes, ought to be inflicted on him; yet pitying the Weakneſs and deplorable Condition of the Criminal, and deſigning to make his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency towards the Offender evident, He, in concert with his own Son, orders it to be proclaim'd every where, that if any Perſon, not obnoxious to the ſame Puniſhment by reaſon of perſonal Guilt, loves the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd ſo well, as to offer himſelf freely to undergo proportionable Penalties to what the Law would have inflicted upon him, the Criminal, acknowledging the Kindneſs
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:102432:371"/> offer'd, and his mighty engagements to his Deliverer, ſhall be free; this Condition once propos'd, the Prince's Son lays hold on the Opportunity to expreſs his Love to the Offender, offers himſelf to die for him, and, ſince the Law requires it and muſt be ſatisfi'd, really does ſo; the Prince, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Proclamation, accepts of his Son's vicarious Puniſhment, the Law and Juſtice have their Courſe, and the grateful Criminal obtains his Freedom: thus are <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Sinners</hi> redeemed from that Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are obnoxious to, with reſpect to infinite Juſtice. The <hi>Socinians</hi> tell us indeed,
<q rend="margQuotes">That Chriſt's Obedience to his Father, even to Death, was no more than was due, on his own account; and that, though it was perfect and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, yet he received Rewards for it, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beyond what he could merit by ſuch Obedience.</q> This is to put our Saviour into the State and Condition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon World; for all thoſe Glories, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to repenting Sinners, are infinitely greater than they, by any perſonal merit, can pretend to; but it ſeems very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that he ſhould take upon him as a Mediator between God and man, or that his Name ſhould be ſo powerfully influential for the advantage of others, who had juſt cauſe to be wholly employ'd in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Gratitude for his Father's Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to himſelf; or to be wholly ecſtaſi'd
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:102432:372"/> with Admirations of that unbounded Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which had confer'd ſuch mighty Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings on him beyond his deſerts; this we rationally ſuppoſe will be the Employ of beatified Souls, and ought to be Chriſt's too, upon the <hi>Socinian Hypotheſis;</hi> we own Chriſt's
<hi>Obedience,</hi> as he was Man, to his Father's Will to have been moſt

<hi>Socinians</hi> do, that <hi>one great meaning of the Death of Chriſt, was, that God, by that means, might give Men a pledge of that Favour or Pardon he intended for them,</hi> is idle: thoſe who had any thing of a <hi>true Notion</hi> of a God, would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon his Word, <hi>authentically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,</hi> without any ſuch extraordinary Pledge; thoſe who had
<hi>perverſe Notions</hi> of him, would take very little notice of ſuch a Pawn given; for the Argument would be very obvious to a Sceptic; <hi>If God be ſuch as ſome define him, infinitely Wiſe, Good, Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, True, there's no need of ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Methods to confirm Men in an opinion of his Veracity; if he be of a different or leſs perfect Nature, a thouſand ſuch Strategems can give us no ſufficient reaſon of Confidence in him.</hi> We find indeed the Ancients, upon Leagues or Compacts between them, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices to their Gods, and with their Hands laid upon the Victim's Head, calling their Gods to witneſs their Sincerity in ſuch Leagues, and making their <hi>ſolemn Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> one to another to obſerve
<hi>propounded Articles;</hi> the deſign of that Ceremony ſeems to be onely to intimate the agreeing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſerious Imprecation, that <hi>their own blood might be ſhed in the ſame manner as that of the dying Victims, in caſe they falſified that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract then made;</hi> but we can imagine nothing <pb n="710" facs="tcp:102432:373"/> of this nature to have paſs'd between God and man in the Death of Chriſt; Men were ſo far conſenting indeed as to ſhed the blood of Chriſt, but far from promiſing Faith and Obedience to their God at the ſame time; no, they acted in plain defiance to thoſe Revelations God had made of himſelf, and thoſe very Perſons, who pretended to the moſt <hi>immediate Dependance</hi> upon Chriſt, had very little Confidence in him, till ſuch time as his <hi>Reſurrection from the dead</hi> recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their fading Hopes, and made them believe he was capable of being their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Redeemer.

<hi>Moſes</hi> was uncapable of ſuch a Mediation, though he interceded for the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by his Prayers, and was earneſt and importunate with God, to turn from that fierce Anger he had juſtly expreſs'd againſt a ſtubborn and ungrateful Generation; but
<hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, at the very time of his zealous Interpoſition for
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> was, as other Men, obnoxious to God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and felt the effect of it, when, for his Tranſgreſſion at the Rock, he was deny'd entrance into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo that in effect he did no more than what's parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly incumbent on God's Prieſts in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>i. e.</hi> to offer Prayers and Supplications for the People they live among, and by ſuch means, to the utmoſt of their ability, to ſtand in the Gap, and to divert threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Judgments from guilty Heads. Our Saviour, as neceſſity required, was <hi>Holy, Harmleſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled, ſeparate from Sinners, one that needed not firſt to pray for Pardon for his own Sins, and afterwards for the Sins of others,</hi> and therefore he might be, and is, properly called <hi>the one Mediator between God and Man,</hi> excluſively of all others;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</note> as we are told in the ſame Text, <hi>there is One God,</hi> excluſively of all other Deities; which could not be, if <hi>Moſes</hi> had been a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the ſame kind and in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as Chriſt was: and it's further added of our Mediator, <hi>That he gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom <pb n="714" facs="tcp:102432:375"/> for all,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> never did; and tho', in the heat of his charitable Zeal, he was willing to have been blotted out of the Book which God had written, that God, by that means, might have been reconciled to his People, that Offer neither was nor could be accepted, becauſe it could be no Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Divine Juſtice, to puniſh one Sinner, and, on account of that puniſhment, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don another; for why ſhould I pretend to ſatisfie that Juſtice, on behalf of another, which, ſhould it proceed ſeverely, would paſs upon me without any ſuch pretence; but he who conſcious of his own Innocence, is ſecure from any legal Danger, may, with reaſon, interpoſe vigorouſly for another. In our preſent Caſe, our Lord endeavours to put an end to that difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, ariſing from Sin; God is the Supreme Law-giver, and has, in his own hand, the uncontroulable Power of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Treſpaſſers upon his Laws; Man is the continual Tranſgreſſor, having, by that means, wholly forfeited all pretences to Grace and Favour; therefore his Caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf deſperate, the Mediation begins on God's part, our Lord not being ſtil'd,
<hi>the Mediator between man and God,</hi> but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man,</hi> the whole Mediation ariſing not from man's hopes, but from God's mercy and goodneſs, which found out the means of reconciling us to himſelf, by his Son. Perhaps a <hi>Socinian</hi> would find it <pb n="715" facs="tcp:102432:375"/> difficult to give a ſatisfactory reaſon why, ſeeing the firſt Covenant, or that between God and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> could be made by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and confirm'd with ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Blood</hi> onely of
<hi>ordinary Victims,</hi> the Evangelical Covenant managed by the Bleſſed Jeſus, a Perſon very much ſuperiour to <hi>Moſes,</hi> could not be confirm'd with <hi>Blood</hi> of like Sacrifices as the former? We'll own freely, the Covenant of the Goſpel is a <hi>better Covenant,</hi> the Promiſes in it more <hi>plain and numerous,</hi> the Hopes rais'd in Men by it <hi>ſtronger and more vigorous;</hi> but all theſe things are accounted for in the Dignity of the Undertaker; and why Chriſtians ſhould not confide in God, upon the ſame terms, on which the Jews did, is not eaſie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; I am ſure they are generally repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as the moſt tractable Perſons. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, there appears a <hi>vaſt Difference</hi> between the Mediatorſhip of our Lord and <hi>Moſes</hi> on theſe accounts; our Saviour, by virtue of his Mediatorial Power, was able
<hi>to remit ſins,</hi> was able to <hi>give eternal Life</hi> to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; but <hi>Moſes</hi> could do no ſuch thing; he was only a Suppliant to God for Pardon for <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> will ſcarce allow, he gave them ſo much as a Promiſe of Eternal Life, throughout the whole Syſteme of his Laws, ſo that though we allow there ought to be ſome reſemblance between the Type and the Anti-type, yet we muſt allow a mighty diſtance between a <hi>Common Man</hi> 
               <pb n="716" facs="tcp:102432:376"/> and one on whom the Title of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> his <hi>onely begotten Son,</hi> was fixt, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance muſt be between Circumſtances capable of being repreſented, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe which are incapable of it. The Death and Paſſion of our Saviour, as an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Accident,</hi> attending his Humanity, might be repreſented by the Death of thoſe Creatures offer'd in Sacrifice frequently to God; the Interceſſion of our Saviour with his Father for a <hi>ſinful World,</hi> by the Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
<hi>Moſes</hi> for a <hi>ſinful Nation;</hi> but that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by Chriſt given for Sinners to his Father's Juſtice, was ſo great a thing, as nothing could make any proportionable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbration of it; the Confeſſion of the Peoples Sins over the Victim's head, and laying their Iniquiries on the Head of the <hi>Scape-Goat,</hi> as a devoted Creature, might keep up ſomewhat of an Idaea of what the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was afterwards to do and ſuffer, and the manner how; but the Symbol was ſo dark, that even the prophecy of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> pointing at the Anti-type, made very little Impreſſion upon the Jews, and made them expect very little from Chriſt, though they ſaw frequent evidences of his Divine Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his Death (as a Perſon devov'd and <hi>made Sin,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it) for the ſafety of the Nation. But there's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fetch, as ſubtle as the reſt, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a Mediator ought to partake of the Nature of both the Parties, between whom <pb n="717" facs="tcp:102432:376"/> he is to make peace, yet this touches not our Saviour; for his Mediatorſhip was only to be employ'd
<hi>in reconciling men to God,</hi> for ſo ſay they, we find <hi>God reconciling the world to himſelf in Chriſt,</hi> but there's no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
<hi>reconciling himſelf to the World,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this aſſertion true, is it therefore impoſſible that God ſhould be angry with a ſinful World? If ſo; how comes it to paſs he ſends ſo many Judgments, particular and general, upon Men, Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries? does he lay his Rod on Mens backs at randome? without any diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Crimes, or without any reſpect to their Demerits? did he drown the old World without being angry with them? burn <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Cities, and yet not diſpleaſed with them? theſe things are incredible: That he was often angry with the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> we find frequently atteſted in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; that, as an evidence of his Anger, he puniſh'd them ſeverely too, we meet with upon record there: If he could be angry with the Sins of a particular People, he may certainly be angry with the Sins of the whole World; for Sin loſes not its odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nature by being more diffuſive: If God be angry with their Sins, he muſt be angry with the Sinners too, eſpecially if they be active and obſtinate in their Sins; for tho' Man, as created at firſt in <hi>the likeneſs or in the image of God,</hi> be good; yet Man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <pb n="718" facs="tcp:102432:377"/> that ſacred Image is defaced by Sin, is odious and deteſtable, a proper object of God's Diſpleaſure, and, of himſelf, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of avoiding it; but if God may be diſpleaſed with Sin and Sinners, and if (his Nature being pure, and his Laws holy, juſt and good) he muſt be ſo, then he muſt be reconciled to Man, or Man muſt be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſerable; and though we find God fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Scripture calling upon Men to <hi>turn to Him,</hi> as if all the Work lay on their hands, yet he promiſes withal, that <hi>He will turn to them;</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>that through Chriſt is preach'd unto you the forgiveneſs of Sins, and by him all that believe are juſtify'd from all things, from which ye could not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law of Moſes:</hi> But here we are to conſider, that the Political as well as the Religious Laws of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> being given at one time by Almighty God, they are ſo blended together, and made Dependents on one another, that where <hi>an ordinary Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> could not, there the <hi>Death of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender</hi> himſelf might ſatisfie for the Crime committed: A Sacrifice offer'd, though by its Inſtitution it were
<hi>expiatory,</hi> yet if the Sinner, however ignorant or weak, perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Sin, or approach'd the Altar of God without true Humility and Repentance for the Sin committed, his Sin could not be pardoned on account of the Sacrifice offer'd, but if ſuch a Sinner did truly repent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Errors, his Offering was then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and not only temporary but eternal Judgments diverted from him; for ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices typified the <hi>Sacrifice of Chriſt,</hi> which was powerful to ſave us from both Worldly Puniſhments and the Damnation of Hell; and as we have before obſerved, the Virtue of thoſe Sacrifices conſiſted wholly in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the Types had to their Antitype. Now, where the Jewiſh political Laws
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:102432:383"/> reach'd the Life of the Delinquent, and took his Blood, there it would have been an Impertinence to offer the Blood of other Creatures for him; but it follows not, but that the ſame Conditions of hearty Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and true Reſolutions of amendment, might procure the Offender's pardon from God, though he ſuffered under the Rigour of the Sanguinary Laws; and the <hi>daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> were of ſome import, with reſpect to ſuch Criminals; and the Blood of Chriſt, though to be ſhed afterwards, was available to the Salvation of ſuch; ſo a Terrour was ſtruck upon Others by the Delinquent's <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sufferings,</hi> and Encouragement was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>greateſt Sinners to repent</hi> by the reaſonable Hopes of <hi>their</hi> being pardoned by Heaven, who yet were to ſuffer upon Earth. And ſo we find among Chriſtians in Chriſtian Governments, the Laws take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of and animadvert upon notorious Sins, ſome are puniſhed by lighter Penalties, ſome by Death it ſelf; yet the Prayers and Interceſſions of the Church offer'd to God, in the name of Chriſt, may be, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are effectual to the Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch Perſons, ſo juſtly ſuffering for their Crimes; but for the Text alledged, the <hi>Import</hi> of it is this, That by the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt we are <hi>really and effectually</hi> freed from all Sins, whereas the Ceremonies of the Law had no ſuch <hi>intrinſic purging Power</hi> of themſelves, all their Validity depending <pb n="731" facs="tcp:102432:383"/> wholly and onely on their Relation to this <hi>All ſufficient Sacrifice</hi> of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>But we are taught by theſe Innovators, that <hi>this Sacrifice was not compleat till our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our enter'd Heaven,</hi>

As for ſome part of their Argument, to prove that Chriſt was not a compleat High-prieſt till his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Heaven, it's more <hi>dark and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible</hi> to me than all thoſe Myſteries in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they pretend to explode:
<hi>for,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſince the Apoſtle aſſerts, that he ought in all things to be like his Brethren, that he might be a compaſſionate and faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, and for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating the Sins of the People,</hi> it's plain that, ſo long as he was not <hi>like to his Brethren in all things, i. e.</hi> in Afflictions and in Death, ſo long he was not a <hi>compleat High-prieſt:</hi> well, is the Conſequence from all this, therefore he was not a <hi>compleat High-prieſt</hi> till he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Heaven before his Father? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs: It will only follow, on their own Principles, that, upon his Death, without that Conſequence, the <hi>expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> was compleated; for there was no <pb n="735" facs="tcp:102432:385"/> need of
<hi>ſanctifying the higheſt Heavens with his own Blood;</hi> nor does this at all abate the neceſſity of Chriſt's Reſurrection or Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Heaven, ſince, without theſe, that Faith fixt in one who had been falſe to his own Promiſes concerning himſelf, who could neither have
<hi>rais'd himſelf nor others,</hi> who could neither have poſſeſt thoſe <hi>eternal Manſions</hi> in his own Perſon, nor have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them for his Followers, who could neither have protected nor aſſiſted them to <hi>the end of the World,</hi> could have been no way juſtifiable; but Chriſt's <hi>aſſimilation to his Brethren,</hi> could proceed no further than to the end of his Sufferings, which ended with his Death upon the Croſs; ſince none of his Brethren had been ſo glorified, or had ſo riſen as <hi>he did,</hi> or ſo aſcended into the preſence of God to make Interceſſion for Sinners; but indeed Death it ſelf was not ſo eſſential to that Reſemblance as they imagine; for whoſoever is liable to <hi>common Infirmities,</hi> and obnoxious to Sufferings, muſt of neceſſity be obnoxious to Death on the ſame reaſon, though he ſhould actually be <hi>tranſlated</hi> with <hi>Enoch,</hi> or <hi>carried up into Heaven</hi> with <hi>Elijah;</hi> for though thoſe holy Men, after ſuch a
<hi>Tranſlation,</hi> were no more in a <hi>mortal ſtate,</hi> yet all that was no greater Privilege than all are Partakers of, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their <hi>final Reſurrection</hi> die no more; or than thoſe who ſhall <hi>be found alive at the day of judgment;</hi> for though ſuch ſhall only be

               <hi>ſubjected to a change,</hi> and not really die as others, yet that hinders not but that, in their own Natures, they ſhall be
<hi>mortal,</hi> and as <hi>liable to Diſtempers,</hi> ſo <hi>to Death,</hi> as well as others. To ſay truth, our Saviour, during the whoſe courſe of his Life, and in all its particulars, liv'd as Men do, and being a Partaker of <hi>real,</hi> and not <hi>fantaſtical Fleſh and Blood,</hi> it was not probable he ſhould live otherwiſe, only in his <hi>exemption from Sin,</hi> he was beyond that general Rule, the Deity not being capable of an Union with any thing imperfect or impure: But having liv'd as <hi>real Man,</hi> and ſuffer'd as <hi>ſuch,</hi> and having by himſelf

<hi>roſe again from the dead,</hi> and though thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> would perſuade us, ſome of his Blood was gathered from under the Croſs, and preſerv'd as a <hi>venerable Relick</hi> by ſome very Pious and Devout Perſons, and may be ſeen at this day by thoſe who have Faith e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; yet we doubt not but that <hi>Blood ſo ſhed was re-united to his Body,</hi> being eaſily gathered, by Almighty Power, from that Diffuſion it had ſuffer'd at his Crucifixion: ſo that though our Lord had <hi>died,</hi> yet his Blood, after <hi>his Reſurrection,</hi> exiſted only as in <hi>a living Body,</hi> therefore it could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before God only as in ſuch a Body; therefore it could not be preſented ſo as the Blood of the <hi>Annual Sacrifice</hi> was by the Jewiſh High-prieſt; nor could the Blood of Chriſt be ſo ſprinkled, as that was, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, or toward the Mercy ſeat; but our Lord's <hi>Aſcenſion into Heaven, and ſitting at the righ-hand of God,</hi> were one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, uninterrupted Act, and that Blood, which had been once offer'd upon the Croſs, needed not to be offer'd again; he was made a <hi>perfect Meſſias,</hi> a <hi>real Saviour through Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> a Saviour every way ſufficient for thoſe who ſhould believe on him: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, through his <hi>own Blood,</hi> made way to the Exaltation of his Humane Nature, he <pb n="738" facs="tcp:102432:387"/> had no more to do, but to ſatisfie his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in the truth of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and to give them proper Inſtructions, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their future Employs, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>aſcend to,</hi> and <hi>to ſit on the right hand of the Majeſty on high, i. e.</hi> to exerciſe that abſolute Dominion and Soveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Believers, as Man, which, as Man, he had purchas'd at the deareſt rate; and, as ſuch, we find him appearing in Apocaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptical Viſions, though at the ſame time bearing that Title,
<hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords;</hi> and thus have we cleared thoſe Proofs, juſtly alledged for our Saviour's Satisfaction for Humane Sins, from
<hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Gloſſes, and irrational Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now add only ſome ſhort <hi>poſitive Evidence</hi> of the ſame Truth, from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Circumſtances attending his Death, and ſo conclude this particular. It muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be remember'd, That one End of our Saviour's exact fulfilling the Law, was, that he might be an example of Holineſs and Obedience to us; but if our Saviour's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were of ſuch a nature, as to import a great deal more than barely ſuch an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then it was really to be conſidered fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Reaſons of that Import to be enquired into. Holineſs includes all ſorts of Vertue, amongſt the reſt, Patience, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Courage, and the like; ſuppoſing our Saviour to have ſatisfied our Heavenly <pb n="739" facs="tcp:102432:387"/> Father for our Sins, to have atoned that Anger juſtly excited againſt a Rebellious World, theſe Vertues were <hi>prodigiouſly emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> in him: the weight of God's Wrath againſt Sin and Sinners was enough, had it been permitted to take its courſe, to have cruſh'd a world of miſerable Wretches; therefore it had been impoſſible for a <hi>meer Man</hi> to have ſtruggled with, and to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that <hi>terrible Indignation</hi> from us; but if we take away this particular Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>treading the wine-preſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Indignation alone,</hi> nothing ſeems more mean, among the various accounts of the Sufferers for Truth, than the Carriage of our Bleſſed Saviour; that Man, whom yet <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves acknowledge to have moved in a Sphere ſuperiour to the reſt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Race. If we look upon that Death our Saviour dy'd, it muſt be own'd, it was <hi>grievous and painful,</hi> yet when we conſider it duly, the <hi>Shame and Ignominy</hi> in it, was the heavieſt Circumſtance attending it: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when we come to compare his Death, as to its outward Circumſtances, with <hi>the Sufferings of Prophets and Martyrs of old,</hi> they were meerly Trifles and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: The Apoſtle tells us, among Faith's ancient Heroes, of
<hi>thoſe who were ſawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder,</hi> ſo we are told, in particular, that great Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſawn with a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Saw, the more dull, the more lingring, the more tormenting; ſo the three Children
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:102432:388"/> were caſt into the <hi>burning fiery Furnace</hi> by
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lions Den, to have been torn in pieces under the cruel Paws of ravening Beaſts; where we are not to look upon the <hi>Miraculous Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> thoſe illuſtrious Sufferers met with, but upon the <hi>barbarous Cruelties intended</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: but if, from them, we come to view the cruel Subtilties of Heathen Perſecutors, there we find all the variety of Tortures exquiſite Malice could invent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted upon poor Chriſtians; the terrible Racks ſtretching their diſabled Limbs, and leaving no ſound Joint in their Bodies, a Torment terrible indeed to the ſtrongeſt natural Conſtitutions, they out-living their Pains, and recovering Strength only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them for renewing Miſeries; ſome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon the Wheel, dying piece by piece, and Nature, in the mean time, ſuſtain'd by Puddle-Water and Excrement; ſome burnt alive in ſcorching Flames; ſome broiled or roaſted before lingring Fires; ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Death by enraged Wild Beaſts; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cloath'd with Pitchy Veſtments, and ſo ſet on fire, to fry away in inexpreſſible Pains, meerly to make ſport, or to ſerve for Flambeaus to midnight Wanderers: What, ſhould we deſcend lower to the poor perſecuted Proteſtants in
<hi>Merindo!</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brieres,</hi> or the unhappy
<hi>Piedmonteſes</hi> of late Years? to ſee Mens Mouths and Womens Privities ſtufft with Gun-powder by barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <pb n="741" facs="tcp:102432:388"/> Villains, and ſo their Bodies or their Heads blown in pieces by that murdering Artifice, to name no more of thoſe <hi>inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Cruelties,</hi> managed ſo, that Holy Men, admirable Chriſtians, have been Days, and Months, and Years a dying; and beſide all this, it was oft-times the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their Sorrows, to ſee their Friends and neareſt Relations murder'd firſt before their Eyes, to have all the unjuſt and ſcandalous Reproaches in the World fixt upon them; for Women to ſee their ſucking Infants thruſt through with Swords, their <hi>own Blood,</hi> and their
<hi>Mothers Milk</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their bleeding Wounds together; to ſee them toſt and carried triumphant upon their Spears, torn from their dying Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ript up Wombs, and thrown immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into conſuming Flames; theſe Sights, ſuch as might rack the moſt reſolute Soul, and almoſt ſqueeze ſympathizing Tears from brute Beaſts or inſenſate Rocks; the very reading thoſe diſmal Tragedies are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make Men ſhiver with Horror, and ſurvey the Bloody Scene with Amazement and Conſternation; yet, after all, we find thoſe glorious Martyrs ſo far from Fear or Apprehenſions of their approaching Fate, that never Happy Pair went, with more cheerful Looks, to the <hi>Bridal Bed,</hi> than they went with to Racks and Wheels, to Flames and Gibbets, or whatever elſe their angry and malicious Enemies could inflict <pb n="742" facs="tcp:102432:389"/> upon them; nay, they were ſo far from being daunted with the cruel Executions of their Fellow Saints, that ambitious Princes were not more active to graſp at Crowns and Sceptres, than they at the more ſplendid bloody Crown of Martyrdome; nay, ſo deſirous were they of that Honour, that whole Multitudes, made up of Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, readily, without being ſought for or accus'd, offered their Throats voluntarily to Pagan Governours, to the Amazement and Confuſion of their moſt violent Perſecutors: If we obſerve the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of thoſe admirable Perſons under their Sufferings, their Management is all of a piece,
<hi>though they were all the day long as Sheep appointed to be ſlain,</hi> though they found their Portion in this World never ſo ſevere or uncomfortable, yet <hi>in all theſe things they were more than Conquerours, through Chriſt who loved them;</hi> they fear'd not the Cruelty of their Enemies, but the Kindneſs of their Friends, leſt, out of Compaſſion to them, they ſhould find out any means to rob them of that Crown they long'd for, Death, though in its moſt dreadful ſhape, was never half ſo terrible to them as ſuch a Diſappointment: in the midſt of all their Pains, not Victors in the fam'd Olympick Games, not young Generals after mighty and unexpected Victories, were poſſeſt with a more exulting Joy, than thoſe triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Saints on their Natalitial days, for ſuch <pb n="743" facs="tcp:102432:389"/> they accounted thoſe times of their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; then happy Viſions pleas'd their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Souls, and an expiring <hi>Stephen</hi> could ſee the Heavens opened, and the Son of Man, his glorious Redeemer, ſitting at the right-hand of God; Flames were to them ſo many Beds of Roſes; Racks and Wheels like yielding Down, or ſoft as Fanning Briezes on a Summer's Evening; no Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, no Complaints were heard, no Tears were ſeen among them, but Songs of Joy, and Praiſe, and Triumph were the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their ſuffering Hours, and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring Souls mounted on them, as on Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic Wings, to <hi>Abraham's Boſom;</hi> and what was the original Ground and Reaſon of all theſe Joys, but only the <hi>certain Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of their Cauſe, the <hi>extraordinary Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of their King and Saviour, and an infallible Aſſurance of God's Love to them, and conſequently of their future and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs;<note place="margin">

               <hi>They reckoned that the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the preſent time were not worthy to be compared to the Glory which ſhould be revealed in them;</hi> and therefore,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35.</note> though <hi>they were tortured, yet they accepted not of Deliverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection;</hi> and all this was agreeable to the Doctrine of the Croſs, as laid down by the Apoſtles in Scripture; here then was the Faith and Patience, the Courage and Reſolution of the Saints; theſe were indeed to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Spirit and Power they acted with <pb n="744" facs="tcp:102432:390"/> was wholly Divine and irreſiſtible; but if, after all this gallant Proſpect of the noble Army of Martyrs, we turn our Looks upon the dying Jeſus, or his behaviour of himſelf under his Sufferings, things will look very differently; we find in him all the evidences of Fear, and Sorrow, and cruel Apprehenſions of that Death he was to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo; <hi>His Soul was exceeding ſorrowful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to death,</hi> he beg'd of his Father, <hi>if it were poſſible, that that bitter Cup might paſs from him,</hi> and though he concluded his Prayer with that reſigning Expreſſion, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs not my will but thy will be done,</hi> yet he repeated his deprecatory Prayer three times, to ſhew how earneſt and real he was in his Requeſts, his Fear and Earneſtneſs produced that <hi>Bloody Sweat,</hi> and brought down <hi>the Angel from Heaven to ſtrengthen him,</hi> all theſe were Prefaces to his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a very diſagreeable Nature to the ſacred Ambition of his own martyr'd Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; when he was in the Agonies of Death, he was ſo far from any Triumphant Expreſſion on the occaſion, that he vented his ſorrowful Spirits in that deſpondent Cry, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me!</hi> we cannot pretend the Bleſſed Jeſus, at this time was under <hi>any alienation of Mind,</hi> under any <hi>diſtraction of Spirit,</hi> by reaſon of the extremity of his Pains; we have ſhewn before, that many ſuffered much <hi>greater Cruelties</hi> for his ſake, than the pains of the <pb n="745" facs="tcp:102432:390"/> Croſs amounted to; conſider it only as the <hi>Roman</hi> Method of putting Slaves to death, and even Pagan Philoſophers have ſuffered much more to the World's eye,
<hi>voluntarily</hi> and <hi>involuntarily,</hi> without any ſuch inward diſtemper, as <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> and <hi>Calanus</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> the former being beaten to pieces in a Mortar by <hi>Nicocreon</hi> the
<hi>Cyprian</hi> Tyrant, the latter walking gravely into the Fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for that purpoſe before <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and there Philoſophizing ſeriouſly and rationally, till his Breath was ſtopt by Smoke and Flames; and our Saviour ſhew'd as great a <hi>Maſtery of his own Thoughts,</hi> and as <hi>undiſturbed Apprehenſions</hi> of things, when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, as at other times; as in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Gall and Vinegar, in diſcourſing with the penitent Thief, in taking care for his bleſſed mourning Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we cannot pretend it was the
<hi>Delicacy</hi> of our Saviour's Body, who being conceiv'd in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Manner, was accompanied with a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Tenderneſs,</hi> for we know its the Soul that ſees in the Eyes, feels in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Members, hears in the Ears, ſuffers in every bleeding Wound, the Body, without its Activity being only a <hi>ſtupid and inſenſible Lump of Earth,</hi> and the Soul of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our being, according to the Confeſſion of all, of a Nature far exalted above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Standard of Mankind, having no Guilt to clog it, no Sin to render it uneaſie, and therefore could not be but far above any <pb n="746" facs="tcp:102432:391"/> groveling Earthy Thoughts, infinitely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Advantages of Death, to thoſe that died in God's Favour, and therefore would more perfectly deſpiſe all the Effects of humane Rage or Malice: we cannot ſay our Saviour was the firſt that ſuffered under the <hi>Inhumanity of Perſecutors,</hi> ſo many of the Prophets had been brought to <hi>violent Deaths</hi> before, not to mention that Perſecution the faithful Jews underwent from the Tyranny of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes;</hi> it cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that Sufferings were the more heavy and inſupportable to our Saviour, becauſe he was conſcious of his own Purity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, ſuch
<hi>a Conſcience of inward Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity</hi> muſt needs be the moſt comfortable Circumſtance in the World for a dying Man, ſuch an Innocent being infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of eternal Reſt and Happineſs in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture World; and it was, among other things, a clear Senſe of their peace being made with God, (which thoſe who are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and harmleſs can never want) that made thoſe eminent Servants of God ſo eager to be Martyrs, knowing <hi>it was better for them to be diſſolv'd and to be with God,</hi> than to linger upon Earth, though compaſſed about with all the Grandeur and Felicity a ſtate of Infirmity can be ſuſceptible of: nor can it be ſuppoſed that the Ingratitude and Baſeneſs of the Jews, among whom he had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for whoſe Conviction he had done ſo many mighty Miracles, could work upon
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:102432:391"/> him ſo much as to preſs him with ſuch
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Sorrows;</hi> it's true indeed, Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to Benefactors is a Crime, it's a very pungent Thought to Men in Adverſity, to ſee thoſe, on whom they have laid the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Obligations, ſtand among their Enemies and promote their Ruine; and it's further true, that never were any Generation of Men more unworthy, or more inſenſible of the moſt powerful Obligations, than the Jews contemporary with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; but, after all this granted, why ſhould our Lord at that time more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pray to his Father, that <hi>the bitter Cup might paſs from him,</hi> when he had all along, through the whole courſe of his Life, found the Jews as ill inclin'd to him as then, but only wanting proper Opportunities to ſhew it? or why ſhould the Bleſſed Jeſus cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> only becauſe the Jews had repay'd his Goodneſs with Ingratitude and Cruelty? beſides, this was the Caſe of our Lord's Diſciples and Followers, as well as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; they preached among both Jews and Gentiles <hi>the glad Tydings of Salvation,</hi> they, aſſiſted by the Influences of the Holy Spirit, did a great many Miracles among them both; yet, where they were moſt venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their Miracles, where moſt zealous to ſpend and to be ſpent for the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, they met with very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Returns, and commonly ſeal'd thoſe
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:102432:392"/> ſaving Truths deliver'd, with their own Blood; ſo that when we have turn'd our ſelves which way ſoever we can, we muſt of neceſſity conclude, either that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs were abundantly more exemplary in their Deaths, than Chriſt himſelf, their Lord and Maſter, which is either Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or very like it; or elſe we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there was ſomewhat diſtinct from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing yet mentioned in the Death of <hi>that Lamb of God,</hi> which made it more <hi>terrible and heavy</hi> than all thoſe exquiſite Tortures expiring Martyrs underwent; for, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that, without any ſuch Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, He, who was emphatically ſtiled <hi>the Son of God, the Son of his Love, that Son in whom he was well pleaſed,</hi> He, who was <hi>One with his eternal Father,</hi> ſhould be afraid of Death, of Humane Cruelties, or complain of Dereliction? is it poſſible he ſhould be able, at any time, to ſend ſuch Aſſiſtances to thoſe who believed on him, as ſhould make them deſpiſe all the Terrors and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a malicious World, and yet himſelf be weak and timid, ſtart at the <hi>ſting of that Death,</hi> which dying Martyrs ſmiled at? is it poſſible that <hi>He who knew no ſin, nor had any guile found in his Mouth,</hi> ſhould tremble before that <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> over whom his own Followers, and only by Faith in him, ſo gloriouſly triumph'd? theſe things are incredible. But let us again conſider our Deareſt Lord as appearing as our Pledge <pb n="749" facs="tcp:102432:392"/> and Surety before his Father, as paying in his Death a <hi>ſatisfactory Price</hi> to his incenſed Father, for the Tranſgreſſions of Mankind; let us conſider him as dying for our Sins, as being made a Curſe for us, therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of Divine Diſpleaſure, on our behalf; as
<hi>being made Sin for us,</hi> as being made by God Juſtification and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us, as <hi>having redeem'd us by his moſt precious Blood,</hi> as having reconciled us to God by his Death; let us remember that he is a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us, through Faith in his Blood, that <hi>He bore our Sins in his Body upon the Croſs,</hi> that he was ſacrificed for us to take away our Sins, for all which Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations we have the undeniable Warrants of Scripture; in ſhort, let us conſider our Saviour as undergoing thoſe <hi>bitter Pains,</hi> in his laſt Sufferings; which, for the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of him the Sufferer, and for the <hi>Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> of the Sufferings themſelves, being <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> as well as
<hi>external,</hi> were equivalent to thoſe <hi>eternal Puniſhments</hi> prepared for Impenitent Sinners; let us but ſeriouſly weigh theſe things, and that the Humane Nature of him who was the <hi>Son of God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhould ſtartle and recoil, can never be incredible; if we look'd upon him as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in this diſmal work, how <hi>prodigious was his Patience,</hi> how <hi>inexpreſſible, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable his Charity!</hi> for him that was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>undefiled</hi> to be <hi>made Sin,</hi> him that was the
<hi>well-beloved Son</hi> to be made a <hi>Curſe,</hi> him,
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:102432:393"/> whom an ungrateful World rejected, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an
<hi>expiatory Sacrifice</hi> for that World; for him, who had never done any Sin, nor deſerv'd any Puniſhment, to undergo the ſevereſt Agonies, and Death it ſelf, for the ſake of obdurate and unconſidering Sinners; theſe are the ſtupendous Effects of inſcruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly myſterious Love; ſuch as, the more a pious Man meditates on, the more he is rapt into Amazement, and the more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he reflects on Humane Demerits, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment grows the more profound; that Man, ſo miſerable, ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that the Son of Man ſhould be ſo mercifully viſited, theſe things obſerv'd, the <hi>ſufferings of Martyrs,</hi> were not worth the naming on the ſame day with the <hi>Sufferings of the Son of God; their Agonies</hi> were ſports compared with <hi>his,</hi> and he dearly purchas'd, by taking off that bitter Cup, all thoſe Comforts, and Joys, and Triumphs, which they afterwards pretended to; He, in his own Perſon, conquer'd firſt thoſe gigantic Monſters, Sin and Death and Hell in open field, he triumph'd over them upon the Croſs, <hi>He led Captivity captive,</hi> and how eaſie was it then for the Sons of Faith to follow the Captain of their Salvation, and to wear thoſe <hi>Crowns of Righteouſneſs</hi> which he had purchas'd for them, with his own moſt precious Blood? when they knew God's Anger was aton'd, that they had <hi>One able to ſave,</hi> continually ſitting on the Right-hand <pb n="751" facs="tcp:102432:393"/> of God, as an Interceſſor for them, when they were infallibly aſſur'd, thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were bleſſed who were
<hi>perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake, for that theirs was the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> it was no wonder that they <hi>rejoiced and were exceeding glad;</hi> nor was it ſtrange, that thoſe who ſuffer'd for the ſake of Truth, before the Incarnation of our Saviour, ſhould expreſs the ſame Courage, they being Partakers of the ſame Faith, and depending as unmoveably upon God's Promiſes made to them, as if they liv'd upon Earth to ſee their utmoſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; ſo that they too had the ſame Mediator, the ſame Redeemer, the ſame Saviour, the ſame glorious Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</p>
            <p>Having thus largely inſiſted upon ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why it was neceſſary that God, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly God the Son, ſhould be incarnate, and conſequently ſuffer for the Salvation of Mankind; we are now to conſider the Force and Import of thoſe Arguments, as laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. That a
<hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be ſent, and on ſuch a ſaving Errand, is a Truth queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by none, but that in a <hi>meer Man</hi> ſuch things ſhould be made good, as were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told concerning him, was impoſſible: for in <hi>a meer Man all the Families of the earth could never have been bleſt,</hi> though they were all ruin'd in one that was no more; for the
<hi>Repairer of Breaches,</hi> the <hi>Reſtorer of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,</hi> the
<hi>Raiſer to Life,</hi> ought to be greater <pb n="752" facs="tcp:102432:394"/> and more powerful than the <hi>ordinary Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of procuring one, or taking away the other; for we ſee how every little Creature can do miſchief, where it requires a greater Care and extraordinary Induſtry to repair that Miſchief when once done; it was no <hi>meer Man</hi> who ſhould <hi>reign for ever, and of whoſe Kingdom there ſhould be no end:</hi> for ſuch a Kingdom requires Eternity in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; the ſtory of Scripture tells us, that, when <hi>Solomon</hi> had finiſhed and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Temple, and the Ark was carried into the <hi>Holy of holies,</hi> upon the Prieſts coming out from thence,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.10, 11.</note>

               <hi>The Redemption of treſpaſſing Mankind from the ſtroke of Juſtice, according to the Father's Intention, required the moſt abſolute Obedience, the greateſt Intereſt, and the moſt extraordinary Compaſſion and Tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mankind:</hi> Now, theſe things were all moſt naturally to be expected from the Son; for Identity or Sameneſs of Will in God the Father is Command and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in God the Son is Submiſſion and Obedience, in God the Holy Ghoſt is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and Aſſiſtance.

<hi>Iſaac</hi> was a conſiderable Type, who, though ſo dear to his Father, ſo vigorous and ſtrong, as he might have been able enough to have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf from the violent Zeal of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Father, though Nature muſt have had ſome Reluctance againſt Death, againſt Death by the hand of his own Father, by his hand from whom he had deſerv'd all Kindneſs and Love by his habitual Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet he ſtopt upon none of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, but was, for ought we can find by the Sacred Story, as ready to be offered as his Parent was to offer him; now, ſuch a kind of Obedience cannot reaſonably be expected from any but a Son, nor from any but the beſt of Sons, ſuch was <hi>Iſaac;</hi> but as the Burden the Son of God undertook was infinitely greater than what <hi>Iſaac</hi> was concerned in; the <hi>Eternal Determination</hi> of Heaven in reſpect of Man, infinitely hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to comply with, ſo it required a Son more Powerful, more Obedient, more united with his Father than any <hi>Earthly Son</hi> could be with the moſt <hi>obliging Earthly Parent;</hi>

They unite indeed all in that one impious Error, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Divinity of our Saviour; a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie deteſtable to every ſober and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Chriſtian; a Hereſie proper only to introduce <hi>Deiſm</hi> and <hi>Sadduciſm,</hi> and to thruſt true Evangelical Chriſtianity out of doors: This, all thoſe who love their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ought to oppoſe and declare againſt, with as much Zeal and Care, and more than they would againſt the fouleſt Errors of the <hi>Roman See:</hi> for, though there are ſo many Falſities and Abſurdities propounded to us in that Communion, yet there's nothing <pb n="781" facs="tcp:102432:408"/> flies ſo directly in the face of Almighty God as this; it's Folly enough to believe the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> Chriſt's <hi>univerſal Vicar</hi> upon Earth, but it's a greater Stupidity to believe that Chriſt himſelf is no more <hi>truly and originally God,</hi> than that pretended Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car; it's Idolatry to pray to Saints or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and to make them the <hi>ultimate Object of our Adorations;</hi> it's greater yet, to make a <hi>meer Man</hi> the Object of the ſame Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to ſuppoſe him a <hi>made God,</hi> and capable of doing every thing for us we beg at his hands, though he were no more but a Creature, as others, at his firſt exiſtence; it's Madneſs to believe that Saints or pious Men may have a <hi>Surpluſage of Merits,</hi> ſuch as may not only ſerve themſelves and their own Neceſſities, but accommodate others who were defective in themſelves; but it's yet a greater Madneſs to believe that the Son of God had no Merits, and was able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe no Pardon for our ſins by his Sufferings, or that by dying for our Sins he was unable to ſatisfie his Father's Diſpleaſure againſt Sinners; the Miſchief and Falſhood of ſuch Opinions, I have proved at large in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parts of this Diſcourſe; yet God, in his Wiſdom, and for the Tryal of thoſe who can adhere ſtedfaſtly to the Truth as it is in Chriſt Jeſus, is pleaſed to permit theſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to be divulged, and defended, and propagated with a miſchievous Diligence, by Men of mighty Names and Intereſts, who, preſuming upon the preſent Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:102432:409"/> aſſume boldly to vent and ſpread thoſe Poiſons they were forc'd to conceal within their own Breaſts before. Time was, when, by the juſt Judgment of God upon the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicean</hi> Temper of the generality of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Arianiſm</hi> got ſtrength, and clouded all the native Glories of the Church of God, it was then when, as St.
<hi>Hierome</hi> ſays, <hi>the World ſtood in amaze to ſee it ſelf grown</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>at once;</hi> God grant the Plague of
<hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm</hi> be not permitted to infect the Church of
<hi>England</hi> with as fatal a Succeſs; that thoſe Damnable Hereſies, wherein the <hi>Lord who bought us</hi> is denied, gain not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us too many Proſelytes and Patrons too! they have indeed their oyly Words, their plauſible Arguments, their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pretences to Morality, and extremity of Confidence, yet could they never hope to prevail, did they not obſerve the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Debauchery and Looſneſs of the Age; they conſider the Principles of ſolid Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as generally ſlighted, the lazy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Men as little careful to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nature of Doctrines propounded, but ready either to ſink into down-right Atheiſm, or to take up with the firſt Scheme of Religion that may come to hand; Men aim more at eminence in what they abuſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call Wit, than at ſerious Piety; and therefore ſubtil watchful Hereticks pretend only to reduce Religion to the Rules of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>i. e. of their own Reaſon,</hi> who have ſtarted ſo many Impieties, though the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <pb n="783" facs="tcp:102432:409"/> of all Mankind beſide themſelves appear in contradiction to them; as if a company of Opinators, who neither value their own nor others Souls, were to fix their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sentiments, as the only Standards of Senſe and Truth, when indeed they have only the <hi>Fucus</hi> of Sophiſtry to make a ſhew of, eaſily obſerv'd by thoſe who ſtand upon their watch, and are willing to be certainly convinced of the Truth of things before they entertain them. There are others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Papiſts, who are only <hi>Wolves in Sheeps clothing,</hi> and by how much the more <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Name</hi> they aſſume to themſelves, by ſo much the more dangerous they are: Every Man is ready to ſtand upon his guard, if he fears being attacqu'd by a <hi>Roman Prieſt,</hi> or by a pragmatick <hi>Jeſuit;</hi> but who would ſuſpect, that any of thoſe who pretend to Tenderneſs of Conſcience, and a ſuperfine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Religious matters, ſhould blaſpheme God the Son, or God the Holy Ghoſt? who would imagine, that thoſe who dare call themſelves Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nay, Attendants at her Altars, Hers, who particularly declares againſt theſe very He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, in thoſe Articles they are oblig'd to ſubſcribe and to defend, ſhould ſo affront their Sacred Mother, and go about to ſeduce her Children from her ſound and wholeſome Doctrines? But, if Apoſtolick times could be peſter'd with ſuch Falſe Teachers, we may expect worſe Meaſure, <hi>upon whom the Ends of the World are come;</hi> but, above all, <pb n="784" facs="tcp:102432:410"/> what can be more aſtoniſhing, than that thoſe who pretend ſo great Good Will to our
<hi>Sion,</hi> ſhould charge the Practice of our Church, in praying equally to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and propoſing the Creeds of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that call'd by the Name of St.
<hi>Athanaſius,</hi> as guilty of Popery, and thoſe things as Reliques of that Idolatrous Religion? <hi>Popery</hi> is a hated name, and thoſe, who would have any thing hated, need to fix nothing more odious upon it; but if it be <hi>Popery,</hi> to believe, that <hi>our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is the Son of God,</hi> that <hi>he is God,</hi> that, by <hi>his Sufferings, he has ſatisfied for our Sins, and now ſits at the right-hand of his Father, making Interceſſion for our Sins,</hi> God grant we may live and die in that Faith: ſince our Caſe is ſuch, take heed how you hear, or what you read; let none deceive you with vain Words; you have heard and read <hi>the Truth;</hi> and if now, or hereafter, We, or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, than what we have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, in this particular, Let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed! and again, Let him be accurſed! <hi>Amen.</hi>
